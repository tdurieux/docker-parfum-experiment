Exposing MySQL to the internet is a very poor security practice. You can \nof course mitigate this with firewalls and sql accounts with ip restrictions or VPNs, but the majority of \nserver admins will not ever do this.\n- Game servers authenticate with the gbans server upon startup of the plugin. Subsequent requests will use the returned\nauthentication token.\n- Communication over HTTPS\n- Discord bot integration for administration & announcements.\n- Built using [Go](https://golang.org/) & [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). It has a built-in \nwebserver that is safe to directly expose to the internet. This means its not necessary to setup MySQL, \nNginx/Apache and PHP on your server.\n- Non-legacy codebase that is (hopefully) not a nightmare to hack on.\n\n## Features\n\n- [ ] Import of existing sourcebans database\n- [ ] Import/Export of gbans databases\n- [ ] Backend linking of gbans services to enable use of other operators lists in real-time.\n- [x] Game support\n   - [x] Team Fortress 2\n- [ ] 3rd party ban lists \n   - [x] [tf2_bot_detector](https://github.com/PazerOP/tf2_bot_detector/blob/master/staging/cfg/playerlist.official.json)\n   - [ ] Known VPN Networks\n   - [ ] Known non-residential addresses \n   - [ ] Known proxies\n- [x] Multi server support\n- [x] Global bans\n- [x] Subnet & IP bans (CIDR)\n- [x] Database support\n  - [x] Postgresql w/PostGIS\n- [x] [Docker support](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/leighmacdonald/gbans)\n- [ ] ACME ([Lets encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) / [Zero SSL](https://zerossl.com/)) protocol support for automatic SSL certificates\n- [ ] SourceMod Plugin\n    - [x] Game server authentication\n    - [ ] `/gb_ban <player_id|steam_id> duration Reason` Ban a user\n    - [ ] `/gb_unban` Unban a previously banned user\n    - [ ] `/gb_kick` Kick a user\n    - [x] `/gb_mod or /mod <message>` Call for a mod on discord\n- [ ] User Interfaces\n    - [x] Discord\n    - [ ] Web\n- [ ] Game server logs\n   - [x] Remote relay agent `gbans relay -h`\n   - [x] Parsing  \n   - [x] Indexing \n   - [ ] Querying\n    \n## Docker\n\nDocker is recommended to run gbans. You can find the official docker images at \n[dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/leighmacdonald/gbans).\n\nAssuming you have created your config file and have a database setup you can run it using something\nlike:\n\n    docker run -it --rm -v `$(pwd)`/gbans.yml:/app/gbans.yml:ro leighmacdonald/gbans:latest\n\nThere is also a docker-compose config you can use which provides the database as well.\n\n    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build --remove-orphans --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from gbans\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor installation, configuration and usage instruction, please see the [docs](docs) directory.\n",
