  "full_description": "> RSS readers are not as clumsy or random as a Twitter client. An\n  elegant weapon for a more civilized age. -- <cite>@marksiegal</cite>\n\nAntisocial is a reader for the true feed junky. The focus is on\nefficiently and swiftly gathering information from hundreds of feeds\nand feeding it to you in a streamlined manner. No share buttons, no\nseeing what feeds your friends are reading. Those things just slow you\ndown. Antisocial is for information directly to your brain via your\neyeballs (best we can do until we get a direct neural interface\nworking).\n\nAntisocial's opinions:\n\n* one central stream that merges entries from all feeds\n* feed entries are presented in chronological order\n* 'j' and 'k' keys for moving through the stream. 'r' to reload and\n  fetch any new items.\n* every UI element that is not necessary for reading and processing\n  large numbers of entries is eliminated.\n\nTechnology:\n\n* Django backend (running on Ubuntu and PostgreSQL)\n* Python feedparser module does the heavy lifting on parsing feeds\n* Backbone.js frontend\n* Celery/RabbitMQ fetch/parse pipeline\n\nBuilt by Anders Pearson <anders@columbia.edu>\n\nLicense: BSD\n\nI've had a few requests for screenshots. Antisocial is purposely quite\nminimal and design-wise it's pretty much just a standard Bootstrap\napplication, so I haven't seen much point in it. Still people keep\nasking, so here's what it looks like:\n\n[![Main Screen](http://reticulum.thraxil.org/image/8e1b05b1bcacf0dc2b004e5a4217f5eff9607a6c/600w/image.png)](http://reticulum.thraxil.org/image/8e1b05b1bcacf0dc2b004e5a4217f5eff9607a6c/full/image.png)\n\n[![Subscriptions](http://reticulum.thraxil.org/image/10fb5d2583a388552e4dccb242f2fb68e04cbd57/600w/image.png)](http://reticulum.thraxil.org/image/10fb5d2583a388552e4dccb242f2fb68e04cbd57/full/image.png)\n\n![add feed](http://reticulum.thraxil.org/image/413788efa82b5bb6328ef12193c92c7400df6509/full/image.png)\n\n![add opml](http://reticulum.thraxil.org/image/e607029f5d686bbc817fb403dd8ccbd8826c3a7a/full/image.png)\n",
