It helps DevOps, SRE and developers to quickly see a cost breakdown and compare different options upfront.\n\n#### Show full breakdown of costs\n\n<img src=\".github/assets/breakdown_screenshot.png\" alt=\"Infracost breakdown command\" width=600 />\n\n#### Show diff of monthly costs between current and planned state\n\n<img src=\".github/assets/diff_screenshot.png\" alt=\"Infracost diff command\" width=600 />\n\n## Quick start\n\n1. Assuming [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) is already installed, get the latest Infracost release:\n\n    macOS Homebrew:\n    ```sh\n    brew install infracost\n    ```\n\n    Linux/macOS manual download:\n    ```sh\n    # Downloads the CLI based on your OS/arch and puts it in /usr/local/bin\n    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infracost/infracost/master/scripts/install.sh | sh\n    ```\n\n    Docker and Windows users see [here](https://www.infracost.io/docs/#quick-start).\n\n2.\tRegister for a free API key:\n    ```sh\n    infracost register\n    ```\n\n    The key is saved in `~/.config/infracost/credentials.yml`.\n\n3.  Run Infracost using our example Terraform project to see how it works:\n    ```sh\n    git clone https://github.com/infracost/example-terraform.git\n    cd example-terraform/sample1\n\n    # Play with main.tf and re-run to compare costs\n    infracost breakdown --path .\n\n    # Show diff of monthly costs, edit the yml file and re-run to compare costs\n    infracost diff --path . --sync-usage-file --usage-file infracost-usage.yml\n    ```\n\nPlease **watch/star** this repo as we add new cloud resources every week or so.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe `infracost` CLI has the following main commands, their usage is described in our short [**getting started**](https://www.infracost.io/docs/#usage) page:\n- `breakdown`: show full breakdown of costs\n- `diff`: show diff of monthly costs between current and planned state\n\nAs mentioned in our [FAQ](https://www.infracost.io/docs/faq), no cloud credentials or secrets are sent to the Cloud Pricing API. Infracost does not make any changes to your Terraform state or cloud resources.\n\n## CI/CD integrations\n\nInfracost's [CI/CD integrations](https://www.infracost.io/docs/integrations/cicd) can be used to automatically add a pull request comment showing the diff of monthly costs between the current and planned state. We have integrations for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Atlantis, Azure DevOps, CircleCI, Bitbucket Pipelines and Jenkins.\n\nIf you run into any issues with CI/CD integrations, please join our [community Slack channel](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat), we'd be happy to guide you through it.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infracost/infracost-gh-action/master/screenshot.png\" width=480 alt=\"Example infracost diff usage\" />\n\n## Supported clouds and resources\n\nInfracost supports over [200 Terraform resources](https://www.infracost.io/docs/supported_resources/) across AWS, Google and Azure. Other IaC tools ([Pulumi](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/187), [CloudFormation](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/190)) are on our roadmap.\n\nWe regularly add support for new resources so we recommend watching this repo for releases: click on the Watch button > selecting Custom > Releases and click on Apply.\n\nSee [this page](https://www.infracost.io/docs/usage_based_resources) for details on cost estimation of usage-based resources such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Storage.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIssues and pull requests are welcome! For development details, see the [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide. For major changes, including CLI interface changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. [Join our community Slack channel](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat), we are a friendly bunch and happy to help you get started :)\n\nWe're also looking for [Sr Full Stack Engineer](https://www.infracost.io/join-the-team) to join our team.\n\n## License\n\n[Apache License 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/)\n",
