The ouput is a set of files representing the genome enriched with variants in IUPAC notation form.\n- index-genome: Tool to find the candidate targets in a genome starting from a PAM. The ouput is a set of files, containing all the sequences of candidate targets extracted from the genome.\n- search: Tool to perform off-target search on a genome (with or without variants) or genome index (with or without variants). The ouput is a set of files, one is a list of all targets and off-targets found, the others are profile files containing detailed information for each guide , like bp/mismatches and on/off-targets count.\n- annotate-results: Tool to annotate results found during search with functional annotations (promoter, chromatin accessibility, insulator, etc). The output is a set of files, one is the list of on/off-targets with the annotation type, the others are files containing counts for each guide, the counts are the total on/off-targets found with the specific mismatch threshold and the specific annotation.\n- generate-report: Tool to generate a graphical report with annotated and overall mismatch and bulge profile for a given guide. The output is a graphical representation of the input guide behaviour.\n- process-data: Tool to process and compare the off-target results done on the reference and enriched genomes. Informations about samples from the 1000 genome project are also provided for each target, giving a multi-level insight on the guide behaviour at general, population and sample level.\n\n# CRISPRitz Installation and Usage\nThe two fastest way to use CRISPRitz is through the installation of Docker or Conda.\nHere we summarize the steps to install CRISPRitz with Docker and Conda.\n\n## Installation (Phase 1)\n**Conda installation (Linux only):**\n- Open a terminal window\n- Paste this command into the terminal (Linux):\n    ```\n    curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh --output Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n    ```\n- If the file is correctly downloaded you now need to execute it to complete the installation, so paste this command into the terminal:\n    - Linux\n    ```\n    bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n    ```\n- Press ENTER when requested and yes when an answer is requested, in this way you allow conda to set all the directories in your HOME path for an easy use\n- After the complete installation you will receive this message “Thank you for installing Miniconda3!” to certify the correct installation.\n- Now you need to close the terminal window you are using and open a new one, to allow the system to start conda.\n- In the new terminal window you should see something like this:\n    ```\n    (base) user@nameofPC:~$\n    ```\n    If you read the \"(base)\" like this, conda is loaded correctly and you can start using it.\n- Now you need to set the channels to allow conda to access different repositories and set the default version of python to version 3.8, so paste these commands into the terminal you just opened:\n    ```\n    conda config --add channels defaults\n    conda config --add channels bioconda\n    conda config --add channels conda-forge\n    conda install python=3.8\n    ```\n- Now, you can install CRISPRitz by typing the command:\n    ```\n    conda install crispritz\n    ```\n- To test your installation, type the command:\n    ```\n    crispritz.py\n    ```\n- After the execution of the command you should see a list of CRISPRitz tools.\n![crispritz.py_help](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40895152/63214203-8452be80-c115-11e9-88e2-4613ba8c3718.png)\nNow the software is installed and ready to be used.\n\n**Docker installation (Linux, Mac OSX and Windows):  \nNote: if you are using MasOS or Windows, you just need to download the installer file\nand follow the on screen instructions.  \nhttps://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/ (Windows)  \nhttps://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/ (MacOS)**\n\n**Ubuntu installation guide:**\n- Open a terminal window\n- Paste this command to update the index repository:\n    ```\n    sudo apt-get update\n    ```\n- Paste this command to allow package installation over HTTPS:\n    ```\n    sudo apt-get install \\\n    apt-transport-https \\\n    ca-certificates \\\n    curl \\\n    gnupg-agent \\\n    software-properties-common\n    ```\n- Paste this command to add the docker key:\n    ```\n    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -\n    ```\n- Paste this command to set the correct version of docker for your system:\n    ```\n    sudo add-apt-repository \\\n    \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\\n    $(lsb_release -cs) \\\n    Stable\"\n    ```\n- Paste this command to update the index repository another time, to make sure everything is ready and set to install docker:\n    ```\n    sudo apt-get update\n    ```\n- Then paste this command to finally install docker:\n    ```\n    sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io\n    ```\n- Paste this last command to check if the installation is complete and functional:\n    ```\n    sudo docker run hello-world\n    ```\n- If this message is printed, everything is perfectly installed\n![docker hello world](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40895152/63214349-769e3880-c117-11e9-8ee2-d754096b3aca.png)\n- Now, we need to do some more steps to complete the settings. Paste this command to create a user group for docker user:\n    ```\n    sudo groupadd docker\n    ```\n- Paste this command to add your current user to the created group:\n    ```\n    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n    ```\n- Now you need to restart your machine or the virtual environment, to re-evaluate the user groups.\n- One last command to test if the group is well configured. Paste this command:\n    ```\n    docker run hello-world\n    ```\n- If the previous “hello from docker” message is printed, everything is perfectly set.\n\n## Post installation test (Phase <a name=\"phase2\">2</a>):\n**Conda:**\n- Download and run this script if you have installed CRISPRitz with Conda:\n    ```\n    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinellolab/CRISPRitz/master/test_scripts/auto_test_crispritz_conda.sh --output auto_test_crispritz_conda.sh\n    ```\n- Write this command to execute the script:\n    ```\n    bash auto_test_crispritz_conda.sh\n    ```\n- Wait until this confirmation message appears:  \n“EVERY TEST PASSED!!! ENJOY CRISPRitz”\n\n**Docker:**\n- Download and run this script if you have installed CRISPRitz with Docker:\n    ```\n    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinellolab/CRISPRitz/master/test_scripts/auto_test_crispritz_docker.sh --output auto_test_crispritz_docker.sh\n    ```\n- Write this command to execute the script:\n    ```\n    bash auto_test_crispritz_docker.sh\n    ```\n- Wait until this confirmation message appears:  \n“EVERY TEST PASSED!!! ENJOY CRISPRitz”\n\n## Usage (Phase 3):\nHere is a brief guide to help use CRISPRitz, **if you already execute the post installation test\n(Phase [2](#phase2)), and you obtain a positive result, you have all the necessary file in the\ntest_crispritz directory and you can skip this list of steps.**  \nIf you did not execute the test, follow these few steps to download the necessary files to try\nCRISPRitz.  \nDownload test files (ONE TIME STEP):\n- The script will download the chr22 from UCSC (hg19), the correspondent VCF file from\nthe 1000 Genome Project, a directory containing some test guides, a directory\ncontaining some PAM sequences and a directory of pre-computed genomic annotations\nfor the hg19 genome.\n- Download the script with this command:\n    ```\n    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinellolab/CRISPRitz/master/test_scripts/download_test_files.sh --output download_test_files.sh\n    ```\n- Write this command to execute the script:\n    ```\n    bash download_test_files.sh\n    ```\n- The script will download every necessary file to test the software, we download only one\nchromosome and one vcf file, to save time. All the examples can be run on an entire\ngenome, if you want to use the entire hg19 genome, you only need to add chromosomes\ninto the `hg19_ref` directory.\n- Write this command to enter the test directory:\n    ```\n    cd test_crispritz/\n    ```\n- Now you are ready to execute the following example functions.\n\n**<a name=\"Add-Variant\">3.1</a> CRISPRitz Add-Variant Tool**  \nThis tool is created to insert variants in a fasta genome.  \nInput:\n- Directory containing a genome in fasta format, need to be separated into single\nchromosome files.\n- Directory containing VCF files, need to be separated into single chromosome files\n(multi-sample files will be collapsed into one fake individual).\n\nOutput:\n- Directory containing a duplicate of the original genome in fasta format, separated into\nsingle chromosome files with added SNPs in IUPAC notation\n- Directory containing a duplicate of the original genome in fasta format, separated into\nsingle chromosome files with added INDELs.\n\nExample call:\n- Conda\n    ```\n    crispritz.py add-variants hg19_1000genomeproject_vcf/ hg19_ref/\n    ```\n- Docker\n    ```\n    docker run -v ${PWD}:/DATA -w /DATA -i pinellolab/crispritz crispritz.py add-variants hg19_1000genomeproject_vcf/ hg19_ref/\n    ```\n\nDetailed input:  \n`hg19_1000genomeproject_vcf/` is the directory containing the vcf files.  \n`hg19_ref/` is the directory containing the fasta files.\n\n\n**<a name=\"Index-Genome\">3.2</a> CRISPRitz Index-Genome Tool**  \nThis tool is created to generate an index genome (similar to the bwa-index step). This step is\ntime consuming (from 30 to 60 minutes) but helps to save a lot of execution time while\nsearching with lot of guides and with the support of bulges (DNA and RNA). If do not need to\nsearch with bulges, skip this passage.  \nInput:\n- Name of the genome to create (e.g. `hg19_ref`).\n- Directory containing a genome in fasta format, need to be separated into single\nchromosome files.\n- Text file containing the PAM (including a number of Ns equal to the guide length) and a\nspace separated number indicating the length of the PAM sequence (e.g. Cas9 PAM is\nNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGG 3).
