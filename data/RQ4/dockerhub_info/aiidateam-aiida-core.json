The event-based workflow engine supports tens of\n     thousands of processes per hour with full checkpointing.\n -   **Data provenance:** Automatically track inputs, outputs & metadata\n     of all calculations in a provenance graph for full\n     reproducibility. Perform fast queries on graphs containing\n     millions of nodes.\n -   **HPC interface:** Move your calculations to a different computer\n     by changing one line of code. AiiDA is compatible with schedulers\n     like [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com), [PBS\n     Pro](https://www.pbspro.org/),\n     [torque](http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/torque/),\n     [SGE](http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/) or\n     [LSF](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSETD4/product_welcome_platform_lsf.html)\n     out of the box.\n -   **Plugin interface:** Extend AiiDA with [plugins](https://aiidateam.github.io/aiida-registry/) for new simulation codes (input generation & parsing), data types, schedulers, transport modes and more.\n -   **Open Science:** Export subsets of your provenance graph and share them with peers or make them available online for everyone\n     on the [Materials Cloud](https://www.materialscloud.org).\n -   **Open source:** AiiDA is released under the [MIT open source license](LICENSE.txt)\n\n## Installation\n\nPlease see AiiDA's [documentation](https://aiida-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n## How to contribute [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com) [![GitHub issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/aiidateam/aiida-core/good%20first%20issue)](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)\n\nThe AiiDA team appreciates help from a wide range of different backgrounds.\nSmall improvements of the documentation or minor bug fixes are always welcome.\n\nPlease see the [Contributor wiki](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/wiki) on how to get started.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\nIf you are experiencing problems with your AiiDA installation, please refer to the [FAQ page of the documentation](https://aiida-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/faq.html).\n\n## How to cite\n\nIf you use AiiDA in your research, please consider citing the following publications:\n\n * **AiiDA >= 1.0**: S.
