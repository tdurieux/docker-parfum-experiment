Please open PRs and issues at https://i2pgit.org/zlatinb/muwire\n\n# MuWire - Easy Anonymous File-Sharing\n\nMuWire is a file publishing and networking tool that protects the identity of its users by using I2P technology. Anyone with a desktop computer and an internet connection can create a unique anonymous online persona and publish information of any kind without fear of censorship or persecution.  MuWire works on any platform Java works on, including Windows, MacOS, Linux, Rapsberry Pi. \n\nUsers can then use their MuWire identities to publish files, search for files published by others, subscribe to each other’s publications and communicate through chat and messaging. Furthermore, users can establish trust-based relationship with each other where they assign a “trust level” to their contacts. \n\nThe current stable release is available for download at https://muwire.com.  `.zip` bundles built from the latest source code are available on the [continuous integration] page.\n\nYou can find technical documentation in the [doc] folder.  Also check out the [Wiki] for various other documentation.\n\n## Building\n\nYou need a JDK version between 11 and 18 inclusive.  Newer versions may not work.  After installing that and setting up the appropriate paths, just type\n\n```\n./gradlew clean assemble\n```\n\nIf you want to run the unit tests, type\n```\n./gradlew clean build\n```\n\nIf you want to build binary bundles that do not depend on Java or I2P, see the [muwire-pkg] project.  If you want to package MuWire for a Linux distribution, see the [Packaging] wiki page.\n\n## Running the GUI\n\nType\n```\n./gradlew gui:run\n```\n\nThe setup wizard will ask you for the host and port of an I2P or I2Pd router.\n\n## Docker\n\nMuWire is available as a Docker image.  For more information see the [Docker] page.\n\n## Reproducible build\n\nThe `zip` distribution of MuWire can be build reproducibly on some systems.  For more info see the [reproducible build] page.\n## Translations\nIf you want to help translate MuWire, instructions are on the wiki [Translate] page.\n\n## Creating your own MuWire network\nIf you want to create your own MuWire network instructions are on the [Wiki].\n\n## Related Projects\n* MuWire Tracker Daemon - The MuWire Tracker Daemon (or mwtrackerd for short) is a project to bring functionality similar to BitTorrent tracking to MuWire.  For more info see the [Tracker] page.\n* [MuCats] - MuCats is a project to create a website for hosting hashes of files shared on the MuWire network.\n* [MuWire Seedbox Daemon](https://github.com/zlatinb/muwire-seedbox-daemon)  A headless daemon that only serves files and is controlled via a JSON-RPC interface.  Suitable for seedboxes.  \n* [MuWire Seedbox Console](https://github.com/zlatinb/muwire-seedbox-console) A web console to manage one or more seedbox daemons.  \n\n\n## GPG Fingerprint\n\n```\n471B 9FD4 5517 A5ED 101F  C57D A728 3207 2D52 5E41\n```\n\n\n\n[Default I2CP port]: https://geti2p.net/en/docs/ports\n[Wiki]: https://github.com/zlatinb/muwire/wiki\n[doc]: https://github.com/zlatinb/muwire/tree/master/doc\n[muwire-pkg]: https://github.com/zlatinb/muwire-pkg \n[Packaging]: https://github.com/zlatinb/muwire/wiki/Packaging\n[cli options]: https://github.com/zlatinb/muwire/wiki/CLI-Configuration-Options\n[I2P Github]: https://github.com/i2p/i2p.i2p\n[Plugin]: https://github.com/zlatinb/muwire/wiki/Plugin\n[Docker]: https://github.com/zlatinb/muwire/wiki/Docker\n[Translate]: https://wiki.localizationlab.org/index.php/MuWire\n[jlesage/docker-baseimage-gui]: https://github.com/jlesage/docker-baseimage-gui\n[Tracker]: https://github.com/zlatinb/muwire/wiki/Tracker-Daemon\n[MuCats]: https://github.com/zlatinb/mucats\n[reproducible build]: https://github.com/zlatinb/muwire/wiki/Reproducible-build\n[continuous integration]: https://github.com/zlatinb/muwire/actions/workflows/gradle.yml\n",
