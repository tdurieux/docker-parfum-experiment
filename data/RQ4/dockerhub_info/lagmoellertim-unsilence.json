Instead of just increasing the playback speed to ~1.5x, you can remove\n    the parts that do not contain any value, like your lecturer thinking or waiting for something. But instead of cutting out these silent parts, speeding them up by a \n    different, much faster factor (think 6-8x) makes you still able to follow what is happening, so drawing or writing with no speech is sped up, which makes it far more pleasant to watch\n    \n- You want a video editor that automatically cuts any time you talk (or make any sound). That could be useful for manual time lapses\n    (you make a sound every time a short segment should be recorded), or for very fast jump cut videos with no manual editing required\n    \n- You want to have some fun and remove all the audible parts from a video, leaving only the parts where nearly silent noises are in the video (breathing, writing, ...)\n\n### Communication\nIf you have any (technical) questions about unsilence or want to get community feedback, you can use the new [GitHub Discussions Feature](https://github.com/lagmoellertim/unsilence/discussions/). To report a bug or suggest a new feature, create a new issue instead. \n\n### Usage Information\n\nUnsilence can be used as a console line interface or as a python library, with which you can develop your own projects\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [Python](https://www.python.org/) >= 3.7.0\n- [pip](https://pypi.org/) (should be installed automatically with python, could be different on some linux distros)\n- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)  >= 4.2.4\n\nIn order to see the fancy progress bar and other terminal styling on windows, you should use [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).\n\n### Installation as command line interface (using pip and pipx)\n\n```sh\n# Installing pipx\npip install pipx\n\n# Installing Unsilence as Command Line Software\npipx install unsilence\n\n# If pipx asks you to, you also need to execute the following line\n# as well as close and reopen your terminal window\npipx ensurepath\n```\n\n### Installation as library (using pip)\n\n```sh\n# Installing Unsilence as Command Line Software\npip install unsilence\n```\n\n### Installation as command line interface (from source)\n\n```sh\n# Clone the repository (stable branch)\ngit clone -b master https://github.com/lagmoellertim/unsilence.git unsilence\n\n#Change Directory\ncd unsilence\n\n# Install pip packages\npip install -r requirements.txt\npip install pipx\n\n# Install unsilence package\npipx install .\n```\n\n### Installation as library (from source)\n\n```sh\n# Clone the repository (stable branch)\ngit clone -b master https://github.com/lagmoellertim/unsilence.git unsilence\n\n#Change Directory\ncd unsilence\n\n# Install pip packages\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# Install unsilence package\npython3 setup.py install\n```\n\n## Basic Command Line Usage\n\nThis generates a new file, where the silent parts are 6x as fast as before, the audible parts are the same speed as before\n```sh\nunsilence [input_file] [output_file]\n``` \nYou can change the speed of audible parts with `-as [speed]`, the speed of silent parts with `-ss [speed]`\n```sh\nunsilence [input_file] [output_file] -as [speed] -ss [speed]\n``` \nYou can change the volume of audible parts with `-av [volume]`, the volume of silent parts with `-sv [volume]`\n```sh\nunsilence [input_file] [output_file] -av [volume] -sv [volume]\n``` \nTo generate an audio only output file, you can add the `-ao` flag\n```sh\nunsilence [input_file] [output_file] -ao\n``` \nTo speed up the rendering process, you can increase the thread count using `-t [threads]`\n```sh\nunsilence [input_file] [output_file] -t [threads]\n``` \nFor many more settings, type `-h` or `--help`\n```sh\nunsilence --help\n``` \n\n## Basic Library Usage\nTake a look at this [example](https://github.com/lagmoellertim/unsilence/blob/master/examples/basic_usage.py)\n\n## Idea/Inspiration\n\nFor this project, I took inspiration from the CaryKH's video [Jumpcutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ8orIurGxw).\nThis project does not share any source code with his implementation, and is more optimized for my use case (fast and efficient lecture silence removal).\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you are missing a feature or have new idea, go for it! That is what open-source is for! ðŸ˜ƒ\n\n## Author\n\n**Tim-Luca LagmÃ¶ller** ([@lagmoellertim](https://github.com/lagmoellertim))\n\n## Donations / Sponsors\n\nI'm part of the official GitHub Sponsors program where you can support me on a monthly basis.\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/lagmoellertim\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://github.com/lagmoellertim/shared-repo-files/raw/main/github-sponsors-button.png\" alt=\"GitHub Sponsors\" height=\"35px\" ></a>\n\nYou can also contribute by buying me a coffee (this is a one-time donation).\n\n<a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/lagmoellertim\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://github.com/lagmoellertim/shared-repo-files/raw/main/kofi-sponsors-button.png\" alt=\"Ko-Fi Sponsors\" height=\"35px\" ></a>\n\nThank you for your support!\n\n## License\n\nThe Code is licensed under the \n\n[MIT License](https://github.com/lagmoellertim/unsilence/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\nCopyright Â© 2019-present, [Tim-Luca LagmÃ¶ller](https://lagmoellertim.de)\n\nAll used videos are licensed under the \n\n[Creative Commons BY-NC-SA License](https://ocw.mit.edu/terms/#cc)\n\n## Have fun :tada:\n",
