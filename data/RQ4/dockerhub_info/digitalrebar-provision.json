DigitalRebar Provision documentation under Digital Rebar master license\n..\n\n.. _rs_welcome:\n\nDigital Rebar\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n*simple, fast and open-ecosystem infrastructure automation with strong Infrastructure as Code (IaC) design.*\n\n`Digital Rebar (aka DRP) <http://rebar.digital>`_ is a `RackN <https://rackn.com>`_ licensed-core platform with an open ecosystem suite of both licensed and open `APLv2 <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalrebar/provision/v4/LICENSE>`_ components.  The fourth generation platform provides a simple yet complete API-driven DHCP/PXE/TFTP provisioning and workflow system.\n\nDigital Rebar Platform and Ecosystem are designed together to be a complete data center provisioning, content scaffolding and infrastructure workflow platform with a cloud native architecture that completely replaces Cobbler, Foreman, MaaS, Ironic or similar technologies. DRP offers a single golang binary (less than 30MB) with no dependencies capable of installation on a laptop, RPi or switch supporting both bare metal and virtualized infrastructure.\n\nKey Features:\n\n  Platform Capabilities:\n    * API-driven infrastructure-as-code automation\n    * Multi-boot workflows using composable and reusable building blocks\n    * Event driven actions via Websockets API\n    * Extensible Plug-in Model for public, vendor and internal enhancements\n    * Dynamic Workflow Contexts (allows using APIs when agents cannot be run)\n    * Distributed Multi-Site Management\n    * Integrated Secure Boot, SSO and Highly Available options.\n    * Supports ALL orchestration tools including Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack, Bosh, Terraform, etc\n\n  Open Ecosystem Plugins:\n    * RAID, IPMI, Redfish, and BIOS Configuration\n    * Cloud-like pooling capabilities\n    * Classification engine for automated workflow\n\n.. figure::  doc/images/dr_provision.png\n   :align:   right\n   :width: 200 px\n   :alt: Digital Rebar Provision\n   :target: https://github.com/digitalrebar/provision\n\n.. _rs_community:\n\nCommunity Resources from https://rebar.digital\n----------------------------------------------\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/digitalrebar/provision.svg?branch=v4\n  :target: https://travis-ci.org/digitalrebar/provision\n  :alt: Build Status\n\n.. image:: https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/digitalrebar/provision/v4\n  :target: https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/digitalrebar/provision/v4\n  :alt: Go Report Card\n\n.. image:: https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/digitalrebar/provision/v4\n  :target: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/digitalrebar/provision/v4\n  :alt: GoDoc\n\n.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/provision/badge/?version=latest\n  :target: http://provision.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n  :alt: Documentation Latest Status\n\n\n* Chat/messaging via the Digital Rebar ``#community`` channel is our preferred communication method.
