  "full_description": "# webЯcade: Feed-driven gaming\n\n[![Actions Status](https://github.com/webrcade/webrcade/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/webrcade/webrcade/actions)\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)\n[![Docker Build Status](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/build/webrcade/webrcade.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/webrcade/webrcade/)\n\nWebЯcade consists of an intuitive [web-based front end](https://docs.webrcade.com/userguide/) that enables playing popular gaming content entirely within the context of the browser across a [wide variety of platforms](https://docs.webrcade.com/platforms/) (Xbox Series X|S, iOS, Android, Windows, macOS). Gamepads are supported (Bluetooth and USB) for both front-end navigation and while playing games.\n\nThe content for playing games (binaries, etc.) and populating the front-end (images, etc.) is collected from [cloud-based resources](https://docs.webrcade.com/feeds/resources/) based on [user-defined feeds](https://docs.webrcade.com/feeds/). Each feed item (game, etc.) has an associated application type. [Application types](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/) include [emulators](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/emulators/) (Atari, Sega, Nintendo) and [game engines](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/engines/) (Classic Doom). \n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <a href=\"https://play.webrcade.com\">\n  <img src=\"https://docs.webrcade.com/assets/images/platforms/ios/safari-full.png?raw=true\" width=\"97%\">\n </a>\n <br>\n <i>webЯcade on Safari for iOS (iPhone)</i>\n</p>\n\n## Play Now.\n\nPlay webЯcade now at [play.webrcade.com](https://play.webrcade.com).\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe [webЯcade Documentation](https://docs.webrcade.com/) consists of a [User Guide](https://docs.webrcade.com/userguide/), instructions specific to each [Platform](https://docs.webrcade.com/platforms/) (OS, devices) supported by webЯcade, detailed information (button mappings, etc.) for the various [Application Types](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/) (emulators, etc.), and guidance for developing your own [Feeds](https://docs.webrcade.com/feeds/).\n\nThe following steps are recommended for getting started with webЯcade:\n\n* Review the [User Guide](https://docs.webrcade.com/userguide/) in order to familiarize yourself with the webЯcade front-end.\n* Read the documentation for the [Platform](https://docs.webrcade.com/platforms/) (OS, device) you will be using with webЯcade to learn platform-specific details such as how to optimize the experience and how to connect gamepads.\n* Review the documentation for each [Application](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/) that is launched to determine its keyboard and gamepad mappings as well as any other application-specific notes (an application is the emulator or engine being used to play a particular game, etc.).\n\n## Default Feed\n\nThe default feed consists of high-quality publicly available games and demos across the various [application types](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/) ([emulators](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/emulators/), [engines](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/engines/), etc.) that are supported by webЯcade.\n\nThe [default feed AUTHORS page](https://github.com/webrcade/webrcade-default-feed/blob/main/AUTHORS-default-feed.md) includes the list of titles that are included in the default feed, their respective authors, and related links. \n\n## What is (and is not) webЯcade?\n\nThe following lists further describe webЯcade in terms of its focus.\n\n**Primary focus:**\n\n* Runs entirely within the web browser leveraging JavaScript, WebAssembly, and the HTML5 gamepad and audio interfaces\n* Adaptive user interface that supports a [wide variety of platforms](https://docs.webrcade.com/platforms/) (Xbox Series X|S, iOS, Android, Windows, macOS)\n* Native gamepad support (Bluetooth and USB) for both front-end navigation and while playing games\n* [User-defined cloud-based feeds](https://docs.webrcade.com/feeds/) identify the resources (images, etc.) required to populate the front-end as well as the content (binaries, etc.) required to play games\n* Each feed item (game, etc.) has an associated application type. [Application types](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/) include [emulators](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/emulators/) (Atari, Sega, Nintendo) and [game engines](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/engines/) (Classic Doom). The quantity and types of applications will continue to expand over time.\n\n**Not focused on:**\n\n* Directly playing locally stored game content (ROMs, etc.)<br>*(Technically possible by using a local web server, but not a primary use case)*\n* The \"latest and greatest\" emulator features and compatibility<br>*(Primary emphasis is on compatibility with popular game content across a variety of platforms while minimizing resource requirements)*\n* Touch-based (virtual) gamepad controls<br>*(The focus is on native gamepad support via Bluetooth and USB)*\n\n## LICENSE\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
