  "full_description": "# amcrest2mqtt\n\nA simple app to expose all events generated by an Amcrest device to MQTT using the\n[`python-amcrest`](https://github.com/tchellomello/python-amcrest) library.\n\nIt supports the following environment variables:\n\n-   `AMCREST_HOST` (required)\n-   `AMCREST_PORT` (optional, default = 80)\n-   `AMCREST_USERNAME` (optional, default = admin)\n-   `AMCREST_PASSWORD` (required)\n-   `MQTT_USERNAME` (required)\n-   `MQTT_PASSWORD` (optional, default = empty password)\n-   `MQTT_HOST` (optional, default = 'localhost')\n-   `MQTT_QOS` (optional, default = 0)\n-   `MQTT_PORT` (optional, default = 1883)\n-   `MQTT_TLS_ENABLED` (required if using TLS) - set to `true` to enable\n-   `MQTT_TLS_CA_CERT` (required if using TLS) - path to the ca certs\n-   `MQTT_TLS_CERT` (required if using TLS) - path to the private cert\n-   `MQTT_TLS_KEY` (required if using TLS) - path to the private key\n-   `HOME_ASSISTANT` (optional, default = false)\n-   `HOME_ASSISTANT_PREFIX` (optional, default = 'homeassistant')\n-   `STORAGE_POLL_INTERVAL` (optional, default = 3600) - how often to fetch storage data (in seconds)\n-   `DEVICE_NAME` (optional) - override the default device name used in the Amcrest app\n\nIt exposes events to the following topics:\n\n-   `amcrest2mqtt/[SERIAL_NUMBER]/event` - all events\n-   `amcrest2mqtt/[SERIAL_NUMBER]/doorbell` - doorbell status (if AD110 or AD410)\n-   `amcrest2mqtt/[SERIAL_NUMBER]/human` - human detection (if AD410)\n-   `amcrest2mqtt/[SERIAL_NUMBER]/motion` - motion events (if supported)\n-   `amcrest2mqtt/[SERIAL_NUMBER]/config` - device configuration information\n\n## Device Support\n\nThe app supports events for any Amcrest device supported by [`python-amcrest`](https://github.com/tchellomello/python-amcrest).\n\n## Home Assistant\n\nThe app has built-in support for Home Assistant discovery. Set the `HOME_ASSISTANT` environment variable to `true` to enable support.\nIf you are using a different MQTT prefix to the default, you will need to set the `HOME_ASSISTANT_PREFIX` environment variable.\n\n## Running the app\n\nThe easiest way to run the app is via Docker Compose, e.g.\n\n```yaml\nversion: \"3\"\nservices:\n    amcrest2mqtt:\n        container_name: amcrest2mqtt\n        image: dchesterton/amcrest2mqtt:latest\n        restart: unless-stopped\n        environment:\n            AMCREST_HOST: 192.168.0.1\n            AMCREST_PASSWORD: password\n            MQTT_HOST: 192.168.0.2\n            MQTT_USERNAME: admin\n            MQTT_PASSWORD: password\n            HOME_ASSISTANT: \"true\"\n```\n\n## Out of Scope\n\n### Multiple Devices\n\nThe app will not support multiple devices. You can run multiple instances of the app if you need to expose events for multiple devices.\n\n### Non-Docker Environments\n\nDocker is the only supported way of deploying the application. The app should run directly via Python but this is not supported.\n\n## Buy Me A ~~Coffee~~ Beer üçª\n\nA few people have kindly requested a way to donate a small amount of money. If you feel so inclined I've set up a \"Buy Me A Coffee\"\npage where you can donate a small sum. Please do not feel obligated to donate in any way - I work on the app because it's\nuseful to myself and others, not for any financial gain - but any token of appreciation is much appreciated üôÇ\n\n<a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dchesterton\"><img src=\"https://img.buymeacoffee.com/api/?url=aHR0cHM6Ly9pbWcuYnV5bWVhY29mZmVlLmNvbS9hcGkvP25hbWU9ZGNoZXN0ZXJ0b24mc2l6ZT0zMDAmYmctaW1hZ2U9Ym1jJmJhY2tncm91bmQ9ZmY4MTNm&creator=dchesterton&is_creating=building%20software%20to%20help%20create%20awesome%20homes&design_code=1&design_color=%23ff813f&slug=dchesterton\" height=\"240\" /></a>\n",
