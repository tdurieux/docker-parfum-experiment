ClamAV version 0.99.2 has\nbeen verified as working.\n\n## Design\n\nPlease refer to the [design document](doc/DESIGN.md) for an overview of how \nthe application updates signatures or mirrors them as a server.\n\n## Components\n\n### sigupdate\n\nThe sigupdate component works in a similar way to the perl script posted on the\n[ClamAV site called `clamdownloader.pl`](https://www.clamav.net/documents/private-local-mirrors).\nHowever, it is written in golang and doesn't require any application runtimes\n(Perl) in order to run. Additionally, it handles some failure cases better. Typically,\nyou would use this tool in a cron job to periodically update your signatures and then\nuse your own webserver to serve those signatures out of your data directory.\n\n#### Usage\n\n```\nUsage: sigupdate [-vV] [-d value] [-i value] [-m value] [-t value] [parameters ...]\n -d, --data-file-path=value\n                Path to ClamAV data files\n -i, --clamav-dns-db-info-domain=value\n                DNS domain to verify the virus database version via TXT\n                record\n -m, --download-mirror-url=value\n                URL to download signature updates from\n -t, --diff-count-threshold=value\n                Number of diffs to download until we redownload the\n                signature files\n -v, --verbose  Enable verbose mode with additional debugging information\n -V, --version  Display the version and exit\n```\n\n##### Data Directory (`data-file-path` or env `DATA_FILE_PATH`)\nUsage of the sigupdate utility requires a directory that is writable by the executing\nuser. Specify that directory with the `-d` flag.\n\n##### Download Mirror URL (`download-mirror-url` or env `DOWNLOAD_MIRROR_URL`)\nThe default URL for downloading updates is `http://database.clamav.net`. However,\nthat URL doesn't make use of the global mirrors available. Please refer to the [ClamAV\nmirrors page](https://www.clamav.net/documents/mirrors) for a list of region specific\nmirrors. For example, if you are in the USA, you may want to use the URL:\n`http://db.us.clamav.net` to download signatures from a list of mirrors in the US region.\n\n##### DNS Version Database Domain (`clamav-dns-db-info-domain` or env `DNS_DB_DOMAIN`)\nThe default domain mapping to a TXT record for resolving that latest ClamAV\nsignatures is: `current.cvd.clamav.net`. Change this value if you want to pull\nsignature version information from your own domain.\n\n##### Diff Count Threshold (`diff-count-threshold` or env `DIFF_THRESHOLD`)\nSometimes your signatures may be so out of date that there are not enough diff files\navailable on the mirrors to provide updates. In particular, this happens if you start\nwith definitions that come directly from a package manager. This value sets the number\nof versions to download diffs for until we update the base signature data file.\n\n### sigserver\n\nThe sigserver component is a stand-alone HTTP server that serves ClamAV signatures.\nSignatures will be updated periodically using the sigupdate component. The update\ninterval will be configurable.\n\n#### Usage\n\n```\nUsage: sigserver [-vV] [-d value] [-h value] [-i value] [-m value] [-p value] [-t value] [parameters ...]\n -d, --data-file-path=value\n                   Path to ClamAV data files\n -h, --houry-update-interval=value\n                   Number of hours to wait between signature updates\n -i, --clamav-dns-db-info-domain=value\n                   DNS domain to verify the virus database version via TXT\n                   record\n -m, --download-mirror-url=value\n                   URL to download signature updates from\n -p, --port=value  Port to serve signatures on\n -t, --diff-count-threshold=value\n                   Number of diffs to download until we redownload the\n                   signature files\n -v, --verbose     Enable verbose mode with additional debugging information\n -V, --version     Display the version and exit\n```\n\nIn addition to all of the parameters available to `sigupdate`, `sigserver` has\nthe following configuration parameters:\n\n##### Port (`port` or env `SIGSERVER_PORT`)\nPort to listen for HTTP requests on - defaults to port 80.\n\n##### Hourly Update Interval (`houry-update-interval` or `UPDATE_HOURLY_INTERVAL`)\nThis parameter configures many hours to wait before updating the signatures from\nthe ClamAV severs.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MPLv2.
