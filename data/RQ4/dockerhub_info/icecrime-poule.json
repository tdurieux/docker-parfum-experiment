It allows\nimplementing snippets of behavior (called [**operations**](http://poule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/operations.html)) once and be able to invoke them in three\ndifferent contexts:\n\n  1. As a one-time operation, on the entire stock of GitHub items.\n  2. As part of a batch job alongside multiple other operations.\n  3. As part of a long-running daemon, either triggered by GitHub webhooks or scheduled.\n\nThe project was created to manage automation on the [Moby project](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/poule.yml).\n\n# Documentation\n\nSee http://poule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.\n",
