It integrates seamlessly with all git hosted services as [GitHub](https://github.com/), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [gogs](https://gogs.io/).\n\n### Live Demo\n\n[https://ci.bleenco.io](https://ci.bleenco.io)\n\n### Quick Start (Video)\n\nVideo presents how easy is to install Abstruse CI and run sample build (2mins).\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmizxTGk92k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmizxTGk92k)\n\n### Preview\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1796022/35201536-9103e1e8-ff1c-11e7-9461-1dc168629597.png\">\n</p>\n\nMore screenshots can be found [here](docs/SCREENSHOTS.md)\n\n## Why Abstruse?\nWe saw many projects relying on outdated open source continuous integration (CI) solutions that were widely adopted in the past, but unfortunately cannot answer new requirements from the industry. On the other hand, commercial CI solutions have all this great features (i.e. Travis CI), but they cost money. Hence, numerous organizations decide to cut costs and go with legacy open source CI solutions or not use CI solutions at all. This kills the code quality and increases software maintenance costs. We want to change this and equip developers with the commercial-grade open source CI solution that differentiates from the rest by simplicity, scalability and up-to-date technology stack.\n\nNot convinced yet? We compared **[Abstruse 1.0.0](https://github.com/bleenco/abstruse)** with the most popular open source CI platform of all times -- **[Jenkins 2.60.3](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins)** -- and measured the time of execution, CPU and memory consumption while running [Java-Design-Patterns 1.17.0](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns) and [Angular 5.0.0-beta.7](https://github.com/angular/angular) tests.\n\n*We used the following machine for benchmarking:\nIntel i7-4700HQ @ 2.40GHz CPU, 12GB DDR3 1600 MHz, 256 SSD.*\n\n### **Abstruse vs Jenkins**\nWhen testing Java-Design-Patterns 1.17.0 (*Figure 1*), Abstruse 1.0.0 outperforms Jenkins 2.60.3 by 25.84% in time, 52.36% in CPU consumption and 45.96% in memory use.\n\nWhen testing Angular 5.0.0-beta.7, Abstruse outperforms Jenkins by 25.84% in time, 6.27% in CPU consumption and 35.49% in memory use.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  CPU Usage (%)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3041169/31200826-a2b4292c-a95c-11e7-8d73-c395f7b37355.jpg\">\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  Memory Usage (GB)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3041169/31200825-a2b3ab3c-a95c-11e7-9d0e-7c48af6730f9.jpg\">\n</p>\n\n*Figure 1*: Testing Java-Design-Patterns 1.17.0 with Abstruse (left) and Jenkins (right).\n\nFor more details on benchmarking visit our [benchmarking section](docs/BENCHMARKING.md).\n\n## Quickstart\n* [Dependencies](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md)\n* [Installation](docs/INSTALLATION.md)\n* [Integrating Git Providers](docs/INTEGRATING_GIT_PROVIDERS.md)\n\n## Working with us\n\nWe would love to receive community support.
