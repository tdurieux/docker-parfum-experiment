Please follow the\n[documentation](https://manimce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) to install manim\nand follow the instructions according to your operating system.\n\nOnce manim is installed there are multiple ways to get VAlgoLang.\n\n#### Mac OSX\n\nVAlgoLang is avaliable on Homebrew using the instructions below:\n```\n    brew tap VAlgoLang/homebrew-valgolang\n    brew install valgolang\n```\n\nTyping `valgolang` in your terminal should show give you access to the compiler.\n\n#### Debian Based Systems\n\n```\ncurl -sLO https://github.com/VAlgoLang/VAlgoLang/releases/download/latest/valgolang_1.0.SNAPSHOT-1_all.deb && sudo dpkg -i valgolang_1.0.SNAPSHOT-1_all.deb\n```\n\n## Web Editor\n\nIf you do not want to install all the dependencies, you can use the [web editor](http://valgolang.netlify.app/) to write and compile code in VAlgoLang.\n\n## Building VAlgoLang Locally\n\nTo get started on your local machine, please do the following:\n\n1. Fork and clone the repository and open in your favourite editor. Since the interpreter is written in Kotlin, our choice is [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).\n2. Install [Manim and its dependencies](https://docs.manim.community/en/latest/installation.html).\n3. Make changes to the compiler as you wish.\n4. Run the following command to build the JAR file for the compiler:\n\n```\n./gradlew build -x test\n```\n\nRemember that you'll need to do this every time you make a change and would like to see its effect.\n\n5. Run the following on a `.val` file to see whether your changes are working as expected:\n\n```\n./compile <your-file-name>.val\n```\n\nDuring development, it might be easier for you to read through the `.py` output file each time you make a change than to wait for Manim to generate a video. In this case, we recommend using the `-p` flag during compilation. For more on the command line arguments for VAlgoLang, see [here](https://valgolang.github.io/usage.html#command-line-arguments).\n\n## Usage\n\nHere is an example on how to use VAlgoLang:\n\n```js\n    let stack = Stack<number>();\n    stack.push(1);\n    let x = stack.pop();\n```\n\nSave this file with the .val extension and run the compiler on it:\n\n```\n    java -jar valgolang.jar <your-file-name>.val out.mp4\n```\n\nThis should save the animation to `out.mp4`, animating the stack with 1 being pushed and popped off the stack.\n\n\n## Documentation\nDocumentation is in progress at [valgolang.github.io](https://valgolang.github.io/).\n\n## Contributing\nWe welcome all contributions!
