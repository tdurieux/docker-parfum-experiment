Installing from the repository is not suitable for a production installation.**\n\nXibo uses Docker to ensure all contributors have a repeatable development environment which is easy to get up and running.\n\nThe very same Docker containers are used in our recommended end user installation to promote consistency from development to deployment.\n\nTo these ends this repository includes a `docker-compose.yml` file to spin up a model development environment.\n\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThe development Docker containers do not automatically build vendor files for PHP or JS, this is left as a developer responsibility. Therefore you will need the following tools:\n\n - Git\n - [Composer](http://getcomposer.org)\n - NPM (coming in 2.0)\n - Docker\n\n\n\n\n\n## Clone the repository\n\nCreate a folder in your development workspace and clone the repository. If you intend to make changes and submit pull requests please Fork us first and create a new branch.\n\n```sh\ngit clone git@github.com:<your_id>/xibo-cms.git xibo-cms\n```\n\n\n\n## Install dependencies\n\nChange into your new folder\n\n```sh\ncd xibo-cms\n```\n\nWe recommend installing the dependencies via Docker, so that you are guarenteed consistent dependencies across different development machines.\n\n### PHP dependencies\n\n```bash\ndocker run --interactive --tty --volume $PWD:/app --volume ~/.composer:/tmp composer install\n```\n\nThis command also mounts the Composer `/tmp` folder into your home directory so that you can take advantage of Composer caching.\n\n### Website dependencies (webpack)\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it --volume $PWD:/app --volume ~/.npm:/root/.npm -w /app node:12 sh -c \"npm install webpack -g; npm install; npm run build;\"\n```\n\n### Mapped Volumes\n\nThe development version of Xibo expects the code base to be mapped into the container such that changes on the host\nare reflected in the container.\n\nHowever, the container itself creates some files, such as the twig cache and library uploads. These locations will need\nto be created and the container given access to them.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make the `cache` and `library` folders and `chmod 777` them. Obviously this is not\nsuitable for production, but you shouldn't be using these files for production (we have containers for that).\n\n\n## Bring up the Containers\n\nUse Docker Compose to bring up the containers.\n\n```sh\ndocker-compose up --build -d\n```\n\n## Login\nAfter the containers have come up you should be able to login with the details:\n\nU: `xibo_admin`\nP: `password`\n\n\n## Translations\nTo parse the translations:\n\n```bash\nrm -R ./cache\ndocker-compose exec web sh -c \"cd /var/www/cms; php bin/locale.php\"\n```\n\n```bash\nfind ./locale ./cache ./lib ./web  -iname \"*.php\" -print0 | xargs -0 xgettext --from-code=UTF-8 -k_e -k_x -k__ -o locale/default.pot\n```\n\nTo import translations:\n\n```bash\nbzr pull lp:~dangarner/xibo/swift-translations\n```\n\nConvert to `mo` format:\n\n```bash\nfor i in *.po; do msgfmt \"$i\" -o $(echo $i | sed s/po/mo/); done\n```\n\nMove the resulting `mo` files into your `locale` folder.\n\n## Swagger API Docs\nTo generate a `swagger.json` file, with the dev containers running:\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose exec web sh -c \"cd /var/www/cms; vendor/bin/swagger lib -o web/swagger.json\"\n```\n\n# Application Structure\n\nTo find out more about the application code and how everything fits together, please refer to \nthe [developer docs](https://xibo.org.uk/docs/developer).\n\n\n\n# Contributing\n\nThe standard licence for Xibo is the [AGPLv3](LICENSE).
