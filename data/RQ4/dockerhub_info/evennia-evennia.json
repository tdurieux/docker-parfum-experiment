  "full_description": "# Evennia MUD/MU\\* Creation System ![evennia logo][logo]\n[![Build Status][unittestciimg]][unittestcilink] [![Coverage Status][coverimg]][coverlink]\n\n\n*Evennia* is a modern library for creating [online multiplayer text\ngames][wikimudpage] (MUD, MUSH, MUX, MUCK, MOO etc) in pure Python. It\nallows game creators to design and flesh out their ideas with great\nfreedom. Evennia is made available under the very friendly [BSD\nlicense][license].\n\nhttp://www.evennia.com is the main hub tracking all things Evennia.\n\n\n## Features and Philosophy\n\nThe Evennia library aims for you to have a fully functioning, if\nempty, online game up and running in minutes. Rather than imposing a\nparticular style, genre or game mechanic we offer a framework on which\nyou build the game of your dreams. The idea is to allow you to\nconcentrate on designing the bits that make your game unique.\n\nCoding in Evennia is done using normal Python modules imported into\nthe server at runtime. All library code is heavily documented and\nEvennia comes with extensive manuals and tutorials. You use Python\nclasses to represent your objects, scripts, players, in-game channels\nand so on. The database layer is abstracted away. This makes it\npossible to create the game using modern code practices using the full\nflexibility and power of Python.\n\n![screenshot][screenshot]\n\nEvennia offers extensive connectivity options, including traditional\ntelnet connections. Evennia is also its own web server: A default\nwebsite as well as a browser-based mud client (html5 websockets, with\nfallback to AJAX) runs by default. Due to our Django and Twisted\nfoundations, web integration is easy since the same code powering the\ngame is also used to run its web presence.\n\nWhereas Evennia is intentionally empty of game content from the onset,\nwe *do* offer some defaults you can build from. The code base comes\nwith basic classes for objects, exits, rooms and characters. There are\nsystems for handling puppeting, scripting, timers, dynamic games\nstates etc. A default command set (completely replaceable with your\nown syntax and functionality) handles administration, building, chat\nchannels, poses and so on. The default setup is enough to run a\n'Talker' or some other social-style game out of the box. We also have\na contributions folder with optional plugins and examples of more\ngame-specific systems.\n\n## Current Status\n\nThe codebase is currently in **Beta**. While development continues,\nEvennia is already stable enough to be suitable for prototyping and\ndevelopment of your own games.\n\n## Where to go from here\n\nIf this piqued your interest, there is a [lengthier\nintroduction][introduction] to read.\n\nTo learn how to get your hands on the code base, the [Getting\nstarted][gettingstarted] page is the way to go. Otherwise you could\nbrowse the [Documentation][wiki] or why not come join the [Evennia\nCommunity forum][group] or join us in our [development chat][chat].\nWelcome!\n\n\n[homepage]: http://www.evennia.com\n[gettingstarted]: http://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki/Getting-Started\n[wiki]: https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki\n[screenshot]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/294267/30773728-ea45afb6-a076-11e7-8820-49be2168a6b8.png\n[logo]: https://github.com/evennia/evennia/blob/master/evennia/web/website/static/website/images/evennia_logo.png\n[unittestciimg]: https://github.com/evennia/evennia/workflows/test-suite/badge.svg\n[unittestcilink]: https://github.com/evennia/evennia/actions?query=workflow%3Atest-suite\n[coverimg]: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/evennia/evennia/badge.svg?branch=master\n[coverlink]: https://coveralls.io/github/evennia/evennia?branch=master\n[introduction]: https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki/Evennia-Introduction\n[license]: https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki/Licensing\n[group]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/evennia\n[chat]: http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=evennia&uio=MT1mYWxzZSY5PXRydWUmMTE9MTk1JjEyPXRydWUbb\n[wikimudpage]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD\n",
