  "full_description": "**Bloom is a REST API caching middleware, acting as a reverse proxy between your load balancers and your REST API workers.**\n\nIt is completely agnostic of your API implementation, and requires minimal changes to your existing API code to work.\n\nBloom relies on `redis`, [configured as a cache](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/bloom/blob/master/examples/config/redis.conf) to store cached data. It is built in Rust and focuses on stability, performance and low resource usage.\n\n**Important: Bloom works great if your API implements REST conventions. Your API needs to use HTTP read methods, namely `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS` solely as read methods (do not use HTTP GET parameters as a way to update data).**\n\n**ðŸ“š The full README is available on GitHub: [valeriansaliou/bloom](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/bloom).**",
