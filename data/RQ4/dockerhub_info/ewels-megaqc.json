We’ve made\nthe repository public, but please bear in mind that it is still under heavy\ndevelopment and changes are being made on a daily basis. It’s safe to\nassume that the database structure is still at risk and that you\nshouldn’t yet trust it to be stable. However, we’d love your help in\ntesting, bug finding and development!\n\n--------------\n\nMegaQC is a web application that you can install and run on your own\nnetwork. It collects and visualises data parsed by MultiQC across multiple runs.\nThe MegaQC home page looks something like this:\n\n.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewels/MegaQC/master/docs/source/images/megaqc_homepage.png\n   :alt: MegaQC homepage\n\n   Screenshot of the MegaQC home page.\n\nIf you are not sure what MultiQC is yet, check out the main `MultiQC\nwebsite`_ and `GitHub repository`_ first. Once MegaQC is installed and running,\nsimply configure MultiQC to automatically save data to the website every time it runs.\nUsers of your group or facility can then replicate MultiQC plots and explore different data\nfields. Data distributions, timelines and comparisons can all be explored.\n\nPlease read the `MegaQC Documentation <https://megaqc.info/docs/index.html>`_\nto learn how to install, deploy and use MegaQC.\n\n.. _MultiQC website: http://multiqc.info\n.. _GitHub repository: https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC\n\n.. |MegaQC| image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewels/MegaQC/master/megaqc/static/img/MegaQC_logo.png\n.. |Docker| image:: https://img.shields.io/docker/automated/ewels/megaqc.svg?style=flat-square\n   :target: https://hub.docker.com/r/ewels/megaqc/\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/ewels/MegaQC.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/ewels/MegaQC\n.. |Gitter| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/gitter-%20join%20chat%20%E2%86%92-4fb99a.svg?style=flat-square\n   :target: https://gitter.im/ewels/MegaQC\n.. |Documentation| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/Documentation-passing-passing\n   :target: https://megaqc.info/docs/index.html\n.. |PyPI| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/megaqc?color=passing\n   :target: https://pypi.org/project/megaqc/\n",
