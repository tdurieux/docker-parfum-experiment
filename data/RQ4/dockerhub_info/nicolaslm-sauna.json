  "full_description": "Sauna\n=====\n\nSauna is a lightweight daemon designed to run health checks and send the results to a monitoring\nserver.\n\nSauna comes batteries included, it is able run many system checks (load, memory, disk...) as well\nas monitor applications (redis, memcached, puppet...). It is easily extensible to include your own\nchecks and can even run the thousands of existing Nagios plugins.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can install it with pip::\n\n   pip install sauna\n\nSee the `documentation <https://sauna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/install.html>`_ for other\ninstallation methods.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nDocumentation for sauna is available at `sauna.readthedocs.io\n<https://sauna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.\n\nPlugins\n~~~~~~~\n\nPlugins are optional modules that provide a set of checks.
