This allows XCMetrics to collect accurate metrics for you to review and keep track during the lifetime of a codebase.\nXCMetrics has collected almost 1 million builds and over 10 billion steps from all Spotify iOS applications since its introduction. It has allowed us to make important and informed decision in regards to our project structure and architecture.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nHead over to our [Getting Started docs](docs/Getting%20Started.md) to see how to integrate XCMetrics in your project.\n\n## Develop\n\nXCMetrics is built using Swift Package Manager, you just need to open the `Package.swift` file in Xcode: \n\n```bash\nxed Package.swift\n```\n\n## Support\n\nCreate a [new issue](https://github.com/spotify/XCMetrics/issues/new) with as many details as possible. It's important that you follow the issue template and include all required information in order for us to get back to you as soon as possible.\n\nReach us at the `#xcmetrics` channel in [Slack](https://slackin.spotify.com/).\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe feel that a welcoming community is important and we ask that you follow Spotify's \n[Open Source Code of Conduct](https://github.com/spotify/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)\nin all interactions with the community.\n\n## Authors\n\nA full list of [contributors](https://github.com/spotify/XCMetrics/graphs/contributors?type=a) can be found on GitHub.\n\nFollow [@SpotifyEng](https://twitter.com/spotifyeng) on Spotify for updates.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2020 Spotify, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nThis product includes software developed by the \"Marcin Krzyzanowski\" (http://krzyzanowskim.com/).\n\n## Security Issues?\n\nPlease report sensitive security issues via [Spotify's bug-bounty program](https://hackerone.com/spotify) rather than GitHub.\n",
