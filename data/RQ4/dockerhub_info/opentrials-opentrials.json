Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and alter its contents as needed.\n   At minimum, you should set the `OPENTRIALS_API_URL` and `DATABASE_URL`. The\n   `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is needed to run the tests. You could leave the\n   `GOOGLE_*` and `FACEBOOK_*` variables as is, although you won't be able to log\n   in. If you leave `AWS_*` and `S3_*`, you won't be able to upload data;\n2. Run `npm install`;\n3. Run `npm run migrate`;\n\nAfter the install and migrations ran successfully, you can run `npm run dev` to\nrun the project. If you haven't changed the default `PORT`, it should be\navailable at `http://localhost:5000`\n\n### Testing\n\nYou can run the test suite and linting with `npm test`.\n\nWe also have an end to end smoke test suite. To run it, make sure the\nOpenTrials server is running and do:\n\n```\nOPENTRIALS_URL=http://localhost:5000 npm run e2e\n```\n\nRemember to change the `OPENTRIALS_URL` to where is the OpenTrials URL.\n\n### Notes\n\nBuilt static files are checked into the git repository for now to simplify Docker workflow.\n",
