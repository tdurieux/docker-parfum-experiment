  "full_description": "# ring-mqtt\nThis script leverages the excellent [ring-client-api](https://github.com/dgreif/ring) to provide a bridge between MQTT and supported products from Ring Inc. products such as cameras, alarm devices/sensors and smart lighting.  While it's primary design goal was to support simple integration with Home Assistant (it supports Home Assistant style MQTT discovery) it can be used with any tool capable of working with MQTT as it provides consistent and simple topic naming based on location/device ID and sensor type.\n\n## !! Important Note for users upgrading to 4.0 !!!\nTopic levels were changed slightly in the move to 4.0 to a simpler format that fits better with the Home Assistant device model implemented in this version.  This should not impact Home Assistant users as new topic levels are automatically handled by the discovery process, however, users of other MQTT tools will probably need to adjust to the new topic levels.  The new topics for each device and sensor are documented in the  [docs/TOPICS.md](https://github.com/tsightler/ring-mqtt/blob/master/docs/TOPICS.md) file.\n\nPlease see the [ring-mqtt project on Github](https://github.com/tsightler/ring-mqtt) for full documentation or to report any issues.",
