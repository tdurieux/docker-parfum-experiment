  "full_description": "# frab - conference management system\n\nfrab is a web-based conference planning and management system.\nIt helps to collect submissions, to manage talks and speakers\nand to create a schedule.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/frab/frab.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/frab/frab)\n[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/frab/frab.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/frab/frab)\n[![Docker Build Status](https://img.shields.io/docker/build/frab/frab.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/frab/frab/)\n\n## Current Status\n\nfrab is not under heavy development anymore.\n[Releases](https://github.com/frab/frab/releases) merely mark huge updates and\nadd a changelog.  There are no separate release branches, fixes and development\nhappen in master.  We want the master branch to be usable at all times.\n\nfrab has been used to organize [FrOSCon](https://froscon.de) since 2011, a\nconference with more than 100 talks (and as many speakers) in more\nthan 5 parallel tracks (plus devrooms) over 2 days.\nfrab is also used by the [Chaos Communication Congress](https://events.ccc.de).\n\nThe frab wiki hosts a [list of conferences using frab](https://github.com/frab/frab/wiki).\n*Feel free to add your conference to the wiki*.\n\nTake a look at the [screenshots](https://github.com/frab/frab/wiki/Screenshots)\nto get an idea of what frab does. The [full\nmanual](https://github.com/frab/frab/wiki/Manual) can be found in the wiki.\n\n## Installing\n\nfrab is a pretty standard Ruby on Rails application.\nThere should be plenty of tutorials online on how to install,\ndeploy and setup these.\n\nSee [installation](INSTALL.md) for more frab specific information.\n\nIt's possible to run frab via [docker](https://github.com/frab/frab/blob/master/README.docker.md), or on a [PaaS](https://github.com/frab/frab/blob/master/README.PaaS.md) like heroku or dokku.\n\n## Rake Tasks\n\nThese are executed from the command line to export conferences and static\nschedules, send emails or help with development.  The manual has a chapter on\n[rake tasks for production](https://github.com/frab/frab/wiki/Manual#managing-frab-in-production).\n\nMore documentation on available [rake tasks](https://github.com/frab/frab/wiki/Rake%20Tasks) can be found in the wiki\nor by running `rails -D`.\n\n## Ticket Server\n\nfrab supports OTRS, RT and Redmine ticket servers. Instead of sending\nevent acceptance/rejection mails directly to submitters, frab adds\na ticket to a request tracker.\n\nThe ticket server type can be configured for every conference.\n\nInstall the iPHoneHandle support if you're using OTRS.\n\n## History\n\nfrab was originally created for the organization of [FrOSCon 2011](http://www.froscon.de).\nFrOSCon has previously used pentabarf (http://pentabarf.org), and although\nfrab is a completely new implementation, it borrows heavily from pentabarf.\n\nBoth FrOSCon and frab owe a lot to pentabarf. But sadly, pentabarf seems to\nbe abandoned. And several problems make it hard to maintain. Thus we decided\nto create a new system.\n\n## License\n\nfrab is licensed under an MIT-License. It bundles some\nthird-party libraries and assets that might be licensed\ndifferently. See LICENSE.\n",
