The archetypical use case is to\nautomate creation of student repositories based on template repositories, that\ncan contain for example instructions and skeleton code. Given any number of\ntemplate repositories, creating a copy for each student or group is\n[just one command away](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/repos.html#set-up-student-repositories-the-setup-action).\nRepoBee also has functionality for\n[updating student repos](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/repos.html#updating-student-repositories-the-update-action),\n[batch cloning of student repos](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/repos.html#cloning-repos-in-bulk-the-clone-action),\n[opening, closing and listing issues](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/issues.html),\n[no-blind](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/peer.html) and\n[double-blind](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/peer.html#double-blind-peer-review)\npeer review, and much more!\n\nIn addition, RepoBee features a powerful\n[plugin system](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/plugins.html) that allows\nusers to either use existing plugins, or\n[write their own](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/repobee_plug/index.html).\nPlugins can do a wide range of things, including making RepoBee compatible with\nmultiple hosting platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea), providing compatibility\nwith repositories managed by GitHub Classroom, or running JUnit4 test classes\non cloned student repositories.\n\nStill not quite sure what RepoBee actually does? The demo video below briefly\nexplains some of the most important concepts, and showcases how RepoBee can be\nused to setup and clone student repositories, as well as how to write a simple\nplugin.\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14223379/121573132-2d725380-ca25-11eb-8aa0-8f50ac3f28f0.mp4\n\n> Short video demonstration of using RepoBee and writing a simple plugin. [For a higher-quality version of this demo, click this link!](https://repobee.org/media/repobee-demo.mp4)\n\n### Feature highlights\nRepoBee has a lot going for it. Here are some of the things we are most proud\nof:\n\n* Compatible with GitHub, GitLab and Gitea: No platform lock-in!\n* Support for group assignments (multiple students per repository)\n* No-blind and double-blind peer review, directly on the hosting platform\n* Generate, clone and update student repositories based on templates\n* Open, close and list issues\n* Extend and customize RepoBee with the\n  [plugin system](https://repobee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugins.html)\n* Very little configuration required on the Git service platform side\n    - The only requirement is to have an Organization/Group with private repository\n      capabilities!\n* No local configuration required\n    - Although [setting a few defaults](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/getting_started.html#configure-repobee-for-the-target-organization-the-config-category)\n      is highly recommended\n\nFor a full list of RepoBee's built-in (i.e. non-plugin) features, see the\n[user guide](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/userguide.html) and\n[CLI reference](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/cli.html).\n\n### Getting started\nFirst, either [install RepoBee](#install) or grab the [Docker image](#docker).\nThen, start exploring the [Docs](https://repobee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),\nwhere you (among other things) will find the [user\nguide](https://repobee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/userguide.html). It covers use\nof RepoBee's various commands by way of practical example, and should set you\non the right path with little effort.\n\nWe also provide a [Gitea test instance](https://gitea.repobee.org) for playing\naround around with RepoBee in an environment where messing up has no\nconsequence. See the\n[RepoBee Gitea docs](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/gitea.html) for details\non how to use RepoBee with Gitea.\n\n### Install\nWe provide an install script that sets up an isolated and correctly configured\nenvironment for RepoBee, granted that you have [Python 3.6+ and Git\ninstalled](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/install.html#requirements). The script\nsupports macOS, Linux and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). You can execute it\ndirectly using `curl`, with either `bash` or `zsh`.\n\n> **IMPORTANT:** If you use any other shell than bash or zsh, you must still\n> execute the install script with one of them.\n\n```bash\n$ bash <(curl -s https://repobee.org/install.sh)\n```\n\n```bash\n$ zsh <(curl -s https://repobee.org/install.sh)\n```\n\nFor additional details, please see [the install\ndocs](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/install.html).\n\n### Docker\nWe offer a fully featured\n[Docker image](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/docker.html#docker-usage)\nthat can be used instead of installing RepoBee.\n\n## Versioning\nAs of December 17th 2018, RepoBee's CLI is a stable release and adheres to\n[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). The internals\nof RepoBee _do not_ adhere to this versioning, so using RepoBee as a library\nis not recommended.\n\nThe plugin system is mostly stable as of RepoBee 3.0, but there is a slight\nrisk of breakage due to unforeseen problems. **If you develop a plugin, please\nget in touch so that can be taken into consideration if breaking changes are\nintroduced to the plugin system**.\n\n## License\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.
