They should have pattern `handler(...args) = function(req, res, next)`\n\n## Environment variables Used\nAll possible configuration variables are listed in `.env.example`. Renaming the file to `.env`  will inject all the environment variables.\n\n|variable | Description | default |\n|---|---|---|\n| WORKERS | number of child processes | 4 |\n|JWK_URL | jwks url for id provider | (*required*) |\n|PORT | the port to use | 4010 |\n|AUD | jwt audience to accept | (if unset, does not check)|\n|ISS | jwt issuer to accept |(if unset, does not check)|\n|EXPIRY | expire in time for jwks| 1d |\n|DISABLE_SEC | set truthy to disable permission and login handlers | false |\n|DISABLE_CSP | set truthy to disable content security policy headers | false |\n|ALLOW_PUBLIC | set truthy to allow public users | false |\n|IIP_PATH | IIP server location | http://ca-iip |\n|MONGO_URI | mongo connection uri | mongodb://localhost |\n|MONGO_DB | mongo db to use, default camic |\n|GENERATE_KEY_IF_MISSING | automatic generate key in server in not found | false |\n|ENABLE_SECURITY_AT| time at which to enable security; [see parsable times](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse)| (not active) |\n\n\n## files used\n`key/key` and `key/key.pub` are used for internal jwts for this service. You can use key/make_key.sh to generate these, or otherwise add your own.\n`./ssl/privatekey.pem` and `./ssl/certificate.pem` are used to enable SSL; if these are present, this application will start in SSL/HTTPS mode.\nThe CSP headers are generated from `contentSecurityPolicy.json`.\n\n## User property variables\nThese are set in userFunction and injected into the token.\n\nuserType -- Null, Editor, Admin as userTypes (e.g. Admin can create users, Editor can create marks, Null can't create anything except logs)\n\nuserFilter -- list of values which must be present in given field in filtered data responses\n\n### Special filter values\n\\*\\* -- immune to filters (can see everything)\nPublic -- users with no userFilter are assigned this filter\nAn item with no filter value is returned in all cases, and is thus also public.\n\n## Local Development Environment\nIn order to quickly setup a development environment, make use of the `setup_script.sh` script. This will setup the project, initialize and seed the database configurations, import routes and initialize environment config files and generate the keys required.\n\nFirst clone the <a href = \"https://github.com/camicroscope/Caracal/tree/backup-dev\">Caracal (backup-dev branch)</a>, <a href = \"https://github.com/camicroscope/caMicroscope\">caMicroscope</a> and the <a href = \"https://github.com/camicroscope/Distro\">Distro</a> repositories and make sure that all of them are in the same parent directory.\n\nRun the script with  `./setup_script` or `bash ./setup_script.sh`\n\nThe script is configured to load a database named \"`camic`\" from server at \"`127.0.0.1`\". In order to specify different name and host, simply pass the two while calling the script, like `./setup_script custom_host custom_database_name`\n\nRun `npm start` to start the application and see it running at `localhost:4010`\n",
