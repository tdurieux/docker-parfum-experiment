You can either set it up as a node app manually, or use the docker image.\n\nFollow [the guide](docs/setup.md) if you are interested, and contact me if you have any questions or notes.\n\n## DankChat integration\nThe [DankChat](https://github.com/flex3r/DankChat) mobile application for Twitch chat uses Supibot's API in order to hint its commands in any channel Supibot is actively in!\nIt's a wonderful app to use on the go, and I endorse it.\n\n## Further reading\n- [Bot feature overview](docs/features.md)\n- [Command docs + how to make your own](https://github.com/Supinic/supibot-package-manager/blob/master/docs/commands.md)\n- [Website API with bot data](docs/api.md)\n",
