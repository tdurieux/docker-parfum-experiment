Install the\nbackend code on a PHP-compatible web server, install the companion app on your\nphone, and you're good to go!\n\n## System Requirements\n\n- Web server running PHP and Memcached or Redis.\n- PHP `memcached`, `memcache` or `redis` extension installed on the web server.\n- PHP `ldap` extension if using LDAP authentication.\n- Android 6 or above to run the [companion Android app](https://f-droid.org/packages/info.varden.hauk/).\n\n## Installation instructions\n\n1. Clone or download this repository:  `git clone https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk.git`\n2. Run `sudo ./install.sh -c web_root` where `web_root` is the folder you want\n   to install Hauk in, for example `/var/www/html`. Follow the instructions\n   given by the install script. Make sure to set a secure hashed password and\n   edit your site's domain in the configuration file after installation.\n3. Start the web server and make sure Memcached or Redis is running and\n   [properly configured and firewalled](https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-securely-configure-memcachedredis).\n4. Install the companion Android app (from your favourite store linked above)\n   on your phone and enter your server's settings.\n\n## Manual installation\n\nIf you prefer not to use the install script, you can instead choose to copy the\nfiles manually.\n\n1. Clone or download this repository: `git clone https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk.git`\n2. Copy all files in the `backend-php` and `frontend` folders to a common folder\n   in your web root, for example `/var/www/html`.\n3. Modify `include/config.php` to your liking. Make sure to set a secure hashed\n   password and edit your site's domain in this file.\n4. Start the web server and make sure Memcached or Redis is running and\n   [properly configured and firewalled](https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-securely-configure-memcachedredis).\n5. Install the companion Android app (from your favourite store linked above)\n   on your phone and enter your server's settings.\n\n## Distribution-specific packages\n\nThe Hauk backend is available as packages for the following distributions:\n\n### Arch Linux\n\nInstall [`hauk-server`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hauk-server/) from\nAUR. The backend will be installed to `/usr/share/webapps/hauk-server`.\n\n## Via Docker Compose\n\nThe official Docker image on Docker Hub is `bilde2910/hauk`. It comes with several different tags:\n\n| Tag | Description |\n| --- | ----------- |\n| `latest` | Updated with each commit to this repository and always has the latest changes. |\n| `stable-1.x` | The latest tagged [release](https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk/releases) of version 1.x. |\n| `X.Y.Z` | A specific release of the Hauk backend. Note that old versions are not supported and are provided for your convenience only. |\n\n`latest`, `stable-1.x` and all releases from `1.5.2` and up are multi-arch and compiled for x86_64, armv7l and aarch64. `1.5.1` and older are x86_64 only. You can use any of these tags for all architectures, and Docker will automatically pick the correct one. If you need the image for a specific architecture, however, you can fetch them using `*-amd64` (x86_64), `*-arm32v7` (armv7l) or `*-arm64v8` (aarch64) versions of any of the tags (e.g. `latest-arm32v7`).\n\n**docker-compose.yml**\n\n```yaml\nversion: '3.4'\n\nservices:\n  hauk:\n    image: bilde2910/hauk\n    container_name: hauk\n    volumes:\n      - ./config/hauk:/etc/hauk\n```\n\nCopy the [config.php](https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk/blob/master/backend-php/include/config-sample.php) file to the ./config/hauk directory and customize it. Leave the memcached connection details as-is; memcached is included in the Docker image.\n\nThe Docker container exposes port 80. For security reasons, you should use a reverse proxy in front of Hauk that can handle TLS termination, and only expose Hauk via HTTPS. If you expose Hauk directly on port 80, or via a reverse proxy on port 80, anyone between the clients and server can intercept and read your location data.\n\nHere's an example config for an nginx instance running in another container. You may want to customize this, especially the TLS settings and ciphers if you want compatibility with older devices.\n\n```nginx\nserver {\n    listen 443 ssl;\n\n    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;\n    ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305';\n    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;\n    ssl_stapling on;\n    ssl_stapling_verify on;\n\n    ssl_ecdh_curve 'secp521r1:secp384r1';\n    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;\n    ssl_session_timeout 10m;\n    ssl_session_tickets off;\n\n    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/hauk.example.com/fullchain.pem;\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/hauk.example.com/privkey.pem;\n\n    add_header Referrer-Policy same-origin always;\n    add_header X-Frame-Options DENY always;\n    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff always;\n    add_header X-XSS-Protection \"1; mode=block\" always;\n    add_header X-Robots-Tag \"noindex, nofollow\" always;\n\n    server_name hauk.example.com;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://hauk:80;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Upgrading to newer versions\n\nHauk is versioned according to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/). Any update that is **not a major update** is guaranteed to be without breaking changes, and you can keep the same configuration file for the updated release.\n\n- Major updates add breaking changes that either require manual intervention, or breaks backward compatibility. Update instructions for major versions will be listed in the release notes, as well as either this README or in the wiki. To date there have been no major updates.\n- Minor updates add functionality, but does not break backward compatibility. You can still use an older client on a newer server, or a newer client on an older server, though some functionality may be missing. This will be dynamically detected by the client and server, which could e.g. lead to some UI elements being disabled in the app, or a notification made if a user tries to use new functionality that the other endpoint does not support.\n- Patch updates are primarily bugfixes.\n\nAside from certain major changes, you can keep your configuration file. New options may have been added to the config, but these will have sane defaults applied automatically. If you wish to change any new options, you can either reconfigure Hauk from the new config.php template, or copy and paste the relevant options from the new template to your existing file and change the appropriate values.\n\nInstallations done using either the installer (`install.sh`) or via manual file copy can be upgraded simply by pulling the latest version of this repository and running the installer again, or overwriting the installation with the new files.\n\nInstallations done via distribution-specific packages will be updated to the latest version by your package manager.\n\nDocker installations will be updated whenever you pull the image. If you're using Docker, you can reserve yourself from receiving major updates (which may contain breaking changes) by using the `stable-*` tag instead of `latest`. If you use a specific versioned tag, your installation will be locked at that specific version and you will not receive feature updates or bugfixes unless you manually change the tag and pull.\n\n## Demo server\n\nIf you'd like to see what Hauk can do, download the app and insert connection details for the demo server:\n\nServer: https://apps.varden.info/demo/hauk/  \nPassword: `demo`\n\nLocation shares on the demo server is limited to 2 minutes and is only meant for demonstration purposes. Set up your own server to use Hauk to its full extent.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Demo server privacy policy - Last updated December 26, 2019</summary>\n\n**Last updated: December 26, 2019**\n\nThe demo server is limited by configuration to shares no longer than 2 minutes. This means that no matter what happens, the location data you send to the demo server will be deleted automatically after at most 2 minutes from session initiation. Location data is never logged to disk in any way and only stays in RAM for this time. After the session ends, the data is no longer available. It is a vanilla installation of Hauk from GitHub and the code has not been altered in any way.\n\nThe server currently uses CloudFlare for DDoS protection, hence CloudFlare can see the data in transit. You may refer to their privacy policy as well.\n\nThe HTTP daemon keeps a standard access log for 7 days. This log contains the link ID (which is useless after the 2 minute session expiration), full URLs, user agents, timestamps, and referring URL (if any). It also logs the IP addresses of the CloudFlare proxy server you connect through. It does *not* contain *your* IP address, only that of a CloudFlare data center somewhere. It's thus not possible to track individuals using it, and not possible to get any meaningful data from it. This log file is used for abuse prevention only.\n\nThe server itself is located in Norway and is thus covered under Norwegian privacy regulations.\n</details>\n\n## Translators\n\nHauk depends on volunteers to translate the project.

Thus, my time spent making this is unpaid. I do however accept donations from anyone who appreciates my work enough that they feel inclined to compensate me, no matter the amount. Donations mean a lot to me, as they help cover costs associated with server upkeep, domains and hosting, and general cost of living, and they serve as an incentive for me to keep working on open-source projects.\n\nIf you wish to donate to me, you may check out my [donations page](https://varden.info/donate.php) on my website.\n",
