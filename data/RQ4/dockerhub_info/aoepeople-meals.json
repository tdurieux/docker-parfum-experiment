Please make sure that `ddev`, `mkcert` and `docker` are installed and run the following to get started:\n```\nddev start\n```\nPoint your webbrowser to https://meals.test :tada:\nDon't forget to add to your local hosts file if not done automatically via ddev: `127.0.0.1 meals.test`\n\n### Rebuild production ready frontend assets\n```\n# get into the container\nddev ssh\n\n# change directory\ncd app/Resources\n\n# build production assets\nyarn build\n```\n\n### Run code linter\n```bash\n# stylelint for SASS files\nddev ssh\ncd /var/www/html/app/Resources\nyarn lint-sass\n```\n\n### SSH Access\n```\nddev ssh\n```\n\n### Common commands\n```\nphp app/console doctrine:schema:update --force\n```\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column\n\n    php app/console doctrine:schema:update --force --env=dev\n\n---\n\n## Developer information\n\n### User roles\n\nThe following roles are in use:\n\n  * ROLE_USER: basically everyone who is allowed to join the meals\n  * ROLE_KITCHEN_STAFF: allowed to create and edit dishes and meals\n  * ROLE_GUEST: for users who is invited for a meal, customers etc.\n  * ROLE_ADMIN: for users who is admin\n  * ROLE_FINANCE: for users who is finance\n\n### Test data\n\nTo load up some test data, run\n\n    php app/console doctrine:fixtures:load --env=dev\n\nIt generates dishes, meals and users.\n\nYou can use \"john\", \"jane, \"alice\" and \"bob\" to login. Their password is just their username.\nThe User \"kochomi\" is allowed to modify dishes and edit meals.\n\n### Running tests\n\nSome tests require a working database. The database dedicated for running tests can be configured by setting\nthe database name in `app/config/parameters.yml` as `database_name_testing`. Credentials should be the same\nas for the dev environment.\n\nBefore running phpunit make sure the database schema is up-to-date:\n\n    sudo -i\n    mysql\n    > CREATE USER 'mealz_test'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mealz_test';\n    > CREATE DATABASE mealz_test;\n    > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mealz_test.* TO 'mealz_test'@'localhost';\n\n    php app/console doctrine:schema:update --env=test --force\n    bin/phpunit -c app/config/commons/development/phpunit.xml\nNotes:\n- With --filter CLASSNAME you can test single Test Classes\n- When you disable xdebug the performance will be better\n",
