There are notable improvements from the previous version:\n\n- Support for any data source - Bluetooth / WiFi / magnetic fields / etc. (previously just WiFi)\n- Passive scanning built-in (previously required a [separate server](https://github.com/schollz/find-lf))\n- Support for Bluetooth scanning in scanning utility (previously just WiFi)\n- Meta-learning with 10 different machine learning classifiers (previously just three)\n- Client uses Websockets+React which reduces bandwidth (and coding complexity)\n- Rolling compression of MAC addresses for much smaller on-disk databases (see [stringsizer](https://github.com/schollz/stringsizer))\n- Data storage in SQLite-database (previously it was BoltDB)\n- Released under MIT license (more commercially compatible than AGPL)\n\nThe API for sending fingerprints (`/track` and `/learn`) and MQTT endpoints are backward compatible. \n\n# Status\n\n*FIND3* is stable and ready for use.\n\n# Contributing\n\n*FIND3* is a framework with multiple components. There are multiple repositories that have the components, including:\n\n- Data storage server [(this repo)](https://github.com/schollz/find3/tree/master/server/main)\n- Machine learning server [(this repo)](https://github.com/schollz/find3/tree/master/server/ai)\n- Command-line tool for gathering fingerprints [(schollz/find3-cli-scanner)](https://github.com/schollz/find3-cli-scanner)\n- Android app for gathering fingerprints [(schollz/find3-android-scanner)](https://github.com/schollz/find3-android-scanner)\n- ESP code for gathering fingerprints with ESP8266/ESP32 [(DatanoiseTV/esp-find3-client)](https://github.com/DatanoiseTV/esp-find3-client)\n\n## Reporting issues\n\nPlease report issues through [this repo's issue tracker](https://github.com/schollz/find3).\n\n# Community\n\nSubscribe to the [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/find3/shared_invite/enQtMzU4MjY0NjE1NjU0LWRkY2JhNWFkM2U3Y2JhY2RlZTQ5ZTdmZTQ2M2UzMjI2MGVmMjZlOWQyZmU3MzM5YzIzOTM0YmYzYmQ3NTQzNjQ) to get latest information about the project and get help.\n\nUse the [FIND mailing list](http://eepurl.com/bhfFI1) for discussion about use and development.\n\n# License \n\nMIT\n",
