  "full_description": "L7mp is a Layer-7, multiprotocol service proxy and a service mesh framework. The emphasis is on *multiprotocol* support, which lets l7mp to handle lots of transport- and application-layer network protocols natively not just the usual TCP/HTTP, and transparently convert between different protocol encapsulations. The intention is for l7mp to serve as an incubator project to prototype the main service mesh features that are indispensable to support network-intensive legacy/non-HTTP applications seamlessly in Kubernetes.\n\nThe distribution contains an *l7mp proxy* component, a programmable proxy that can stitch an arbitrary number of application-level traffic streams together into an end-to-end stream in a protocol-agnostic manner (e.g., you can pipe a UNIX domain socket to a WebSocket stream and vice versa).\n\nSee https://l7mp.io and https://www.npmjs.com/package/l7mp.",
