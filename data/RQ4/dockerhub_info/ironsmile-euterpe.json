  "full_description": "# Euterpe\n\nEuterpe is a music streaming software you can run yourself. It will give you access to your music everywhere you go. Either via its built-in web UI or via any of its clients. You could run it on your home computer, laptop or on a deticated server. Think of it as your own personal <insert-streaming-service-name> where you have full control over everything. It indexes your music and gives you convenient and fast access to it. You could search for particular tracks, albums or artists. Or you could browse them as if you are in a music store.\n\n## Usage\n\n```\ndocker run -v \"${HOME}/Music/:/root/Music\" -p 8080:9996 ironsmile/euterpe:latest euterpe\n```\n\nThen point your browser to http://localhost:8080.\n\n## Using Specific Release\n\nOne might want to use a specific build of Euterpe and not `latest` .
