  "full_description": "# Flightpath\n\nFlightpath has been deprecated since the release of [Ingress Gateway in Consul v1.8.0][].  \nThis repository is now in read only mode and will not accept community contributions.\n\n![Test](https://github.com/Gufran/flightpath/workflows/Test/badge.svg?branch=master)\n\nFlightpath is an Envoy Control Plane that integrates with Consul Connect and provides L7 routing\nat edge.\n\nThe need for Flightpath emerged from desperately wanting to deploy Consul Connect to production\nand frustration of not being able to route public traffic to a connect enabled service.  \n\n## Getting Started\n\nGetting started with Flightpath is unfortunately not a one command experience. Flightpath itself is not capable of handling\ntraffic or proxying requests. It provides a simple gRPC server for Envoy xDS API and serves configuration to Envoy. Traffic\nhandling and routing is all performed by Envoy.\n\nTo watch Flightpath in action you will need a basic apparatus that is easy to setup on your local machine. Please see the\n[Documentation](https://docs.flightpath.xyz/) on how to setup a local test environment and go on a test flight.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project no longer accepts contribution.\n\nIt remains open source under Mozilla Public License v2 and you are free to maintain your own fork.\n\n## License\n\nFlightpath is licensed under Mozilla Public License v2.0.
