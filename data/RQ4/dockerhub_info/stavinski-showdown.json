  "full_description": "# Summary\n\nShowdown is a tool that utilises shodan in order to find targets of interest, it should be used at the start of an external test whilst other scans and enumeration are being performed, and allows for an efficient way of knowing which targets should be focused on initially.\n\nIt uses a plugin model and comes with built-in plugins to that should give good coverage on items such as vulnerabilities, SSL/TLS however if there are certain items not covered that you need then it's simple to write your own to cover these and better still send a PR to get it introduced to the built-in library!\n\nFor full details visit https://github.com/stavinski/showdown",
