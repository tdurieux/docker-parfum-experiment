[Appraisal] is an umbrella term for the many processes by which\narchivists identify records of enduring value for preservation in an archive.\nDocNow is an appraisal tool for the social web that uses Twitter.\n\nDocNow allows archivists to tap into conversations in Twitter to help them\ndiscover what web resources are in need of archiving. It also connects\narchivists with content creators in order to make the process of archving web\ncontent more collaborative and consentful. The goal of DocNow is to help ensure\nethical practices in web archiving by building conversations between archivists\nand the communities they are documenting.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThis repository houses the complete DocNow application which is comprised of a\nfew components:\n\n* a client side application (React)\n* a server side REST API (Node)\n* a database (PostgreSQL)\n* a messaging queue database (Redis)\n\n## Production\n\nIf you are running DocNow in production you will want to check out\n[docnow-ansible](https://github.com/DocNow/docnow-ansible) which allows you to\nprovision and configure DocNow in the cloud.\n\n## Development\n\nTo set up DocNow locally on your workstation you will need to install [Git] and\n[Docker]. Once you've got them installed open a terminal window and follow\nthese instructions:\n\n1. git clone https://github.com/docnow/docnow\n1. cd docnow\n1. cp .env.docker .env\n1. docker-compose build --no-cache\n1. docker-compose up\n1. make some ☕️\n1. open http://localhost:3000\n\nIf you run into an error above\n\n1. sh clean-up.sh\n\nIf you notice that the `redis` container occasionally errors out run this in the\nhost operating system as root (not in the Redis container):\n\n```bash\nsysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1\n```\n\n[Git]: https://git-scm.com/\n[Docker]: https://www.docker.com/\n[Appraisal]: https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/appraisal\n",
