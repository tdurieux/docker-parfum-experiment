How do I\nmanage multiple printers from one place? That's where OctoFarm steps in, add your OctoPrint instances to the system and\nit will scan and keep you up to date on the status of your printers.\n\nBuilt by a maker, for makers to get more out of their OctoPrint run farms.\n\n- Manager your OctoPrint instances right down to triggering Updates and Plugin installs.\n- Keep a track of all the live data on your farm with a selection of views.\n- Manage your OctoPrint file system.\n- Get an overview of your farm with the customisable dashboard.\n- Manage and track filament on your farm.\n- Track history and logs for all of your instances.\n- Supports a wide variety of OctoPrint plugins to augment the OctoFarm system with more information.\n\nDocker Run:\nYou can get up and running quite easily with the command below. It's recommended to use the docker-compose instructions below for a more persistent configuration.\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d --name octofarm -e \"MONGO=mongodb://{ mongoip }/octofarm\" -p4000:4000 octofarm/octofarm -e \"TZ=America/Chicago\" -v '{your persistent folder}/OctoFarm/scripts/':/scripts/':'rw' -v '<your persistent folder>/OctoFarm/logs/':'/app/logs/':'rw' -v './OctoFarm/images':'/app/images':rw'\n```\n\nDocker Compose:\nPay good attention that you have to configure your root-user's username and password for MongoDB and that OctoFarm needs it to work!\n\n```bash\nversion: '3.4' \n\nservices:\n  mongodb:\n    image: mongo:latest\n    container_name: mongodb\n    environment:\n      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: MONGO_ROOTUSER_HERE\n      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: MONGO_PASSWORD_HERE\n      MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE: octofarm\n    volumes:\n    # Local volume (change to mongodb-data for a named volume folder)\n      - ./mongodb-data:/data/db\n    restart: unless-stopped\n\n  octofarm:\n    container_name: octofarm\n    # choose octofarm/octofarm:latest\n    image: octofarm/octofarm:latest\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    links:\n      - mongodb\n    ports:\n      - 4000:4000 # port of SYSTEM : port of CONTAINER\n    environment:\n      - MONGO=mongodb://MONGO_ROOTUSER_HERE:MONGO_PASSWORD_HERE@mongodb:27017/octofarm?authSource=admin\n    volumes:\n    # Volumes as local relative folders (validate with 'docker-compose config')\n      - ./OctoFarm/logs:/app/logs\n      - ./OctoFarm/scripts:/app/scripts\n      - ./OctoFarm/images:/app/images\n```\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n## Need help?\n\nFeel free to join any of the OctoFarm communities or follow OctoFarms progress on it's blog.\n\n- [OctoFarms Website](https://octofarm.net/)\n- [OctoFarms Documentation](https://docs.octofarm.net/)\n- [OctoFarm Blog](https://octofarm.net/blog/)\n- [Community Support on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/octofarm/)\n- [Community Support on Discord](https://discord.gg/vjabMUn/)\n- [General Question or Feature Request?](https://github.com/OctoFarm/OctoFarm/discussionss/)\n- [Fancy donating to the project?](https://octofarm.net/sponsorship/)\n\n\n\n## License\n\nThis work [is licensed](https://github.com/OctoFarm/OctoFarm/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).\n\n## Contact\n\nYou can contact me at [info@notexpectedyet.com](mailto:info@notexpectedyet.com)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n- [My Patreons](https://www.patreon.com/NotExpectedYet) - You all keep me going and afford me a financial incentive to keep OctoFarm up to date with new features and fixes!
