How do I do this? quick start!\n\nThis will run Toga, which contains a sample component :\n\n```\ngit clone git@github.com:notonthehighstreet/toga.git\ncd toga\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\nGo to `http://localhost:8080`\n\nCheckout [example/README.md](/example/README.md) more detail about the examples.\n\n## Serving your own components from Toga\n\n* Setup Your Components Project :\n  * Write a universal component e.g. [test-one](/tests/e2e/components/test-one/index.js)\n  * Add a [toga.json](/toga.json.md) file to the root of your components project\n  * Install Toga\n    * `npm i -S noths-toga `\n* Run Toga using npm scripts:\n  * `toga start`\n\nGo to `http://localhost:8080`\n\n## Toga end-points\n\nOut of the box, Toga serves both minified and unminified JS and CSS as well as their SourceMaps.\n\n### Component Assets\n\nThe endpoint to get the assets for a single component is can be found using the `assets-bundle` endpoint\n\n * `http://localhost:8080/asset-bundles`\n\nThis URL will tell you what bundles are available (which is determined form your `toga.json` file).\nThis files will be available on the server address prefix i.e. `http://localhost:8080/`\n\n### Vendor Bundles\n\nIf you have components that share modules, like React, It makes sense to setup a Vendor bundle.\nTo see how to setup a vendor bundle, take a look at [/toga.json](/toga.json.md) or we have a [vendor example](/example/README.md#vendor-javascript).\n\nThe vendor bundle file name can also be found at the `asset-bundles` end-point.\n\n## Passing props to components\n\nYou can pass props to components, just like you would any React component.\n\n### GET\n\nOne Toga is running, you can hit the component endpoint, using the query `?props={\"prop-name\":\"prop-value\"}` in the address bar (props must be valid JSON).  For example:\n\n`http://localhost:8080/HelloWorld.html?props={\"world\":\"waynes\"}`\n\n### POST\n\nOne Toga is running and you can hit the component endpoint, using a `POST` with a body containing your props.\n\n## Analysing your build\n\nOnce you have created your bundle (`npm run bundle -- --components=./components-dir`), a web-page will be generated which allows you to see what files are included in your bundles.\nThis allows you to see if a small library is accidentally bloating your package.\n\nit will be generated in : `/dist/webpack-components-stats.html`\n\n## Logger\n\nBy default, the logger used is based on `banyun` library. It writes to a file (default: `./toga.logstash.log`) and also sends information to `honeybadger`. However, you can pass a custom logger instance, when booting the `toga` server.\n```js\nlet options = {\n  logger: loggerInstance\n};\n\nToga(initialState, options).then(() => console.log('Server up and running'));\n```\n\nThe new logger instance must have the following methods:\n- info\n- error\n- warn\n\n## Contributing\n\n > More information about how to contribute and run the project locally.\n\n[Contributing.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n",
