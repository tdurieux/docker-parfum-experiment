The goal of actionhero is to create an easy-to-use toolkit for making **reusable** & **scalable** APIs for HTTP, WebSockets, and more. Clients connected to an actionhero server can [**consume the api**](https://www.actionherojs.com/tutorials/actions), [**consume static content**](https://www.actionherojs.com/tutorials/file-server), and [**communicate with each other**](https://www.actionherojs.com/tutorials/chat). Actionhero is cluster-ready, with built in support for background tasks, 0-downtime deploys, and more. Actionhero provides a simple Async/Await API for managing every type of connection and background task.\n\nCurrently actionhero supports the following out of the box...\n\n- [Web Clients](https://www.actionherojs.com/tutorials/web-server): HTTP, HTTPS\n- [Web Socket Clients](https://www.actionherojs.com/tutorials/websocket-server): HTTP, HTTPS\n\n[... and you can also make your own servers and transports.](https://www.actionherojs.com/tutorials/servers)\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Generate a new Project\nnpx actionhero generate\nnpm install\nnpm run build\nnpm run dev # <-- I automatically notice changes and restart, as well as compiling .ts files\n\n# Use the actionhero CLI\n(npx) actionhero generate action --name my_action\n(npx) actionhero generate task --name my_task --queue default --frequency 0\n\n# Test\nnpm test\n\n# To deploy your app\nnpm run build\nnpm run start\n```\n\nYour new project will come with example actions, tests, and more.\n\nOr deploy a free API server now:\n\n[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/actionhero/actionhero)\n\n## Learn More ðŸ“š\n\n- [Getting Started @ www.actionherojs.com](https://www.actionherojs.com/get-started)\n  - Actionhero's website can be found @ [https://github.com/actionhero/www.actionherojs.com/](https://github.com/actionhero/www.actionherojs.com/).

Data, software, and communication can be used for bad: to entrench unfair power structures, to undermine human rights, and to protect vested interests. But they can also be used for good: to make underrepresented peopleâ€™s voices heard, to create opportunities for everyone, and to avert disasters. This project is dedicated to everyone working toward the good.\n>\n> > Inspired by Martin Kleppmann\n",
