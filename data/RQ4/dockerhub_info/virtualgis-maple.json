Maple was born out of the necessity to provide such migration path. Our goals have been to:\n\n - Allow an organization to continue using Viewer for Flex while the issues of a new application development are sorted out.\n - Keep configurations between the legacy application and the new application in sync, allowing for a transition period in which both applications can be available to users.\n\nAs a result of such goals, the configuration files in Maple have a 1-to-1 correspondence to those of legacy Flex applications.\n\n![maple-diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1951843/41065327-55b2e012-69ac-11e8-977f-41f81feb73e6.png)\n\nA tool that automates the migration of legacy configuration files is available at https://maple.virtualgis.io\n\nUsers can also write the configuration files for new projects manually or use one of the many [XML to JSON converters](http://www.utilities-online.info/xmltojson/) to convert their existing projects.\n\n## Demo\n\n* [Hello United States](https://mapledemo.virtualgis.io/). A simple public map showcasing LayerList, eMapSwitcher and Bookmark widgets.\n* [Construction Demo](https://mapledemo.virtualgis.io/?p=superiordemo). A more complex configuration featuring user-based authentication (via the built-in user store) and showcasing LayerList, Legend, eMapSwitcher, Bookmark, Search, Locate, ElevationProfile, WMSLooping, Print, Query, ImportDataFile, Link, Measure, eDraw widgets.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Install and configure a web server of your choice (Windows users can use [XAMP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), which also installs PHP).\n2. Install and configure PHP.\n3. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/virtualgis/maple/archive/master.zip) of Maple and extract it in the root folder of your web server.\n4. Go to http://localhost to make sure the default application loads.\n5. Change the configuration files in `config/projects/default` for your application (documentation coming soon).\n\n## Getting Started wih Docker\n\nIf you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) you can simply run:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d -p 80:80 -v path/to/your/config:/var/www/html/config/projects/default virtualgis/maple\n```\n\nThen open a web browser to http://localhost.\n\n## Creating Configuration Files\n\nCurrently looking at the existing configuration examples in `config/projects` is the easiest way to learn how to write configuration files for Maple.\n\nA tool that automatically migrates configuration files coming from a legacy Flex Viewer application will also be available soon, so that you don't have to do it by hand.\n\n## Supported Widgets\n\nWe currently support the following widgets:\n- [X] Search\n- [X] Query\n- [X] Bookmark\n- [X] eTime\n- [X] WMSLooping\n- [X] Legend\n- [X] Link\n- [X] Routes\n- [X] Locate\n- [X] ImportDataFile\n- [X] Edit\n- [X] LayerList\n- [X] eMapSwitcher\n- [X] Measure\n- [X] eDraw\n- [X] ElevationProfile\n- [X] Print\n- [X] ConfigSelectSplash (Maple has support for multiple profiles)\n\nIf you don't see one that you need in this list, open an [issue](https://github.com/virtualgis/maple/issues/new) to request it.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe best source of documentation is currently to look at the [examples](https://github.com/virtualgis/maple/tree/master/config/projects). We are planning to expand our documentation in the upcoming months.\n\n## Support the Project\n\nThere are many ways to contribute back to the project:\n\n - Help us test new and existing features and report [bugs](https://www.github.com/virtualgis/maple/issues) and [feedback](https://gitter.im/virtualgis/maple).\n - ⭐️ us on GitHub.\n - Spread the word about Maple on social media.\n - While we don't accept donations, you can purchase a [premium support contract](mailto:info@virtualgis.io).\n - Become a contributor.\n \n ## Contributing\n\nThe easiest way to get started is to take a look at our list of outstanding issues and pick one. You can also fix/improve something entirely new based on your experience with Maple. All ideas are considered and people of all skill levels are welcome to contribute.\n\nYou don't necessarily need to be a developer to become a contributor. We can use your help to write better documentation and improve the user interface texts and visuals.\n\nIf you know how to code, we primarily use Javascript (Dojo/jQuery), PHP, HTML and SCSS.\n\nIf you have questions come to [Gitter](https://gitter.im/virtualgis/maple) and we'll be happy to help you out with your first contribution.\n\n## License\n\nThe reason for selecting the [AGPL v3.0](https://github.com/virtualgis/maple/blob/master/LICENSE) as our open source license is to require that enhancements to Maple be released to the community. Traditional GPL often does not achieve this anymore as a huge amount of software runs in the cloud.\n\nIf use of the AGPL v3 does not satisfy your organization’s legal department (some will not approve GPL in any form), commercial licenses are available. Feel free to [contact us](https://virtualgis.io/contact) for more details.\n\n## ESRI Licensing and Attribution\n\nMaple is based on ESRI's Javascript SDK.
