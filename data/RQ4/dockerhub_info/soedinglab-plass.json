The main purpose of Plass is the assembly of complex metagenomic datasets. It assembles 10 times more protein residues in soil metagenomes than Megahit. Plass is GPL-licensed open source software that is implemented in C++ and available for Linux and macOS. The software is designed to run on multiple cores. Plass was used to create a Soil Reference Catalog (SRC) and a Marine Eukaryotic Reference Catalog (MERC).\n\n[Steinegger M, Mirdita M and Soeding J. Protein-level assembly increases protein sequence recovery from metagenomic samples manyfold. Nature Methods, doi: doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0437-4 (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0437-4).\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soedinglab/plass/master/.github/plass.png\" height=\"256\" /></p>\n\n\n## Soil Reference Catalog (SRC) and Marine Eukaryotic Reference Catalog (MERC)\nSRC was created by assembling 640 soil metagenome samples. MERC was assembled from the the metatranscriptomics datasets created by the TARA ocean expedition. Both catalogues were redundancy reduced to 90% sequence identity at 90% coverage.\nEach catalog is a single FASTA file containing the sequences, the header identifiers contain the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) identifiers.\nThe catalogues can be downloaded [here](http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/plass/current_release/).\nWe provide a [HH-suite3](https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite) database called \"BFD\" containing sequences from the Metaclust, SRC, MERC and Uniport at [here](https://bfd.mmseqs.com/).\n \n### Install Plass\nPlass can be install via [conda](https://github.com/conda/conda) or as statically compiled Linux version. Plass requires a 64-bit Linux/MacOS system (check with `uname -a | grep x86_64`) with at least the SSE4.1 instruction set.\n\n     # install from bioconda\n     conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda plass \n     # latest static linux build\n     wget https://mmseqs.com/plass/plass-static_sse41.tar.gz; tar xvfz plass-static_sse41.tar.gz; export PATH=$(pwd)/plass/bin/:$PATH\n \n\n## How to assemble\nPlass can assemble both paired-end reads (FASTQ) and single reads (FASTA or FASTQ):\n\n      # assemble paired-end reads \n      plass assemble examples/reads_1.fastq.gz examples/reads_2.fastq.gz assembly.fas tmp\n\n      # assemble single-end reads \n      plass assemble examples/reads_1.fastq.gz assembly.fas tmp\n\n      # assemble single-end reads using stdin\n      cat examples/reads_1.fastq.gz | plass assemble stdin assembly.fas tmp\n\n\nImportant parameters: \n\n     --min-seq-id         Adjusts the overlap sequence identity threshold\n     --min-length         minimum codon length for ORF prediction (default: 40)\n     -e                   E-value threshold for overlaps \n     --num-iterations     Number of iterations of assembly\n     --filter-proteins    Switches the neural network protein filter off/on\n\nModules: \n\n      plass assemble      Assembles proteins (i:Nucleotides -> o:Proteins)\n      plass nuclassemble  Assembles nucleotides *experimental* (i:Nucleotides -> o:Nucleotides)\n      \n### Assemble using MPI \nPlass can be distrubted over several homogeneous computers. However the TMP folder has to be shared between all nodes (e.g. NFS). The following command assembles several nodes:\n\n    RUNNER=\"mpirun -np 42\" plass assemble examples/reads_1.fastq.gz examples/reads_2.fastq.gz assembly.fas tmp\n\n\n### Compile from source\nCompiling PLASS from source has the advantage that it will be optimized to the specific system, which should improve its performance. To compile PLASS `git`, `g++` (4.6 or higher) and `cmake` (3.0 or higher) are required. Afterwards, the PLASS binary will be located in the `build/bin` directory.\n\n      git clone https://github.com/soedinglab/plass.git\n      cd plass\n      git submodule update --init\n      mkdir build && cd build\n      cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. ..\n      make -j 4 && make install\n      export PATH=\"$(pwd)/bin/:$PATH\"\n        \n:exclamation: If you want to compile PLASS on macOS, please install and use `gcc` from Homebrew. The default macOS `clang` compiler does not support OpenMP and PLASS will not be able to run multithreaded. Use the following cmake call:\n\n      CXX=\"$(brew --prefix)/bin/g++-8\" cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. ..\n\n#### Dependencies\n\nWhen compiling from source, PLASS requires `zlib` and `bzip`.\n\n### Use the docker image\nWe also provide a Docker image of Plass. You can mount the current directory containing the reads to be assembled and run plass with the following command:\n\n      docker pull soedinglab/plass\n      docker run -ti --rm -v \"$(pwd):/app\" -w /app plass assemble reads_1.fastq reads_2.fastq assembly.fas tmp\n\n## Hardware requirements\nPlass needs roughly 1 byte of memory per residue to work efficiently. Plass will scale its memory consumption based on the available main memory of the machine. Plass needs a CPU with at least the SSE4.1 instruction set to run. \n\n## Known problems \n* The assembly of Plass includes all ORFs having a start and end codon that includes even very short ORFs < 60 amino acids. Many of these short ORFs are spurious since our neural network cannot distingue them well. We would recommend to use other method to verify the coding potential of these. Assemblies above 100 amino acids are mostly genuine protein sequences. \n* Plass in default searches for ORFs of 40 amino acids or longer. This limits the read length to > 120. To assemble this protein, you need to lower the `--min-length` threshold. Be aware using short reads (< 100 length) might result in lower sensitivity.\n",
