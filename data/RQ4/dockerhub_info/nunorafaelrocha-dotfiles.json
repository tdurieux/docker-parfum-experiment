These are mine. :sunglasses:\n\n**Supported Operating Systems**\n\n| OS     | Version                                                    | CI                                                                                                                              |\n| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| macOS  | Mojave (10.14) <br/> Catalina (10.15) <br/> Big Sur (11.0) | ![macOS](https://github.com/nunorafaelrocha/dotfiles/workflows/Test%20macOS/badge.svg)                                          |\n| Ubuntu | Bionic Beaver (18.04) <br/> Focal Fossa (20.04)            | [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/nunorafaelrocha/dotfiles.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/nunorafaelrocha/dotfiles) |\n\n## üîß Installation\n\n**via curl**\n\n```sh\nbash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nunorafaelrocha/dotfiles/main/bin/dot)\"\n```\n\n**via git**\n\n```sh\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/nunorafaelrocha/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles\ncd ~/.dotfiles\n./bin/dot\n```\n\n## üîÅ Update\n\n`dot` is a simple script that installs some dependencies, sets sane macOS\ndefaults, and so on. Tweak this script, and occasionally run `dot` from\ntime to time to keep your environment fresh and up-to-date. You can find\nthis script in `bin/`.\n\n## üíÑ Customization\n\nEverything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.\n\nThe main file you'll want to change right off the bat is `zsh/zshrc.symlink`,\nwhich sets up a few paths that'll be different on your particular machine.\n\n### topics\n\nEverything's built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to your\nforked dotfiles ‚Äî say, \"node\" ‚Äî you can simply add a `node` directory and put\nfiles in there. Anything with an extension of `.zsh` will get automatically\nincluded into your shell. Anything with an extension of `.symlink` will get\nsymlinked without extension into `$HOME` when you run `dot` or `dot --link`.\n\n### components\n\nThere's a few special files in the hierarchy.\n\n- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made\n  available everywhere.\n- **Brewfile**: This is a list of applications for [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io) to install: things like Chrome and 1Password and stuff. Might want to edit this file before running any initial setup.\n- **topic/\\*.zsh**: Any files ending in `.zsh` get loaded into your\n  environment.\n- **topic/path.zsh**: Any file named `path.zsh` is loaded first and is\n  expected to setup `$PATH` or similar.\n- **topic/completion.zsh**: Any file named `completion.zsh` is loaded\n  last and is expected to setup autocomplete.\n- **topic/install.sh**: Any file named `install.sh` is executed when you run `dot` or `dot --install`. To avoid being loaded automatically, its extension is `.sh`, not `.zsh`.\n- **topic/\\*.symlink**: Any file ending in `*.symlink` gets symlinked into\n  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles\n  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get\n  symlinked in when you run `dot` or `dot --link`.\n\n## üôè thanks\n\nI forked [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman)'s awesome\n[dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) which were an easy way to start my own customization.\n",
