Run tests? Here's a full overview of what roger\ncan do with your project:\n\n``` yaml\nredis:\n  dockerfilePath: some/subdir # location of the dockerfile, omit this if it's in the root of the repo\n  registry:       127.0.0.1:5001\n  revfile:        somedir # means roger will create a rev.txt file with informations about the build at this path\n  after-build: # hooks to execute after an image is built, before pushing it to the registry, ie. tests\n    - ls -la\n    - npm test\n  notify:\n    - github\n    - emailSes\n    - slack\n  publish:\n    -\n      to: s3\n      copy: /src/build/public/ # this is the path inside the container\n      bucket: my-bucket # name of the s3 bucket\n      bucketPath: initial-path # the initial path, ie. s3://my-bucket/initial-path\n      command: gulp build # optional: a command to run right before publishing (you might wanna build stuff here)\n```\n\nWant to build 2 projects from the same repo?\n\n``` yaml\nredis:\n  dockerfilePath: src\nredis-server:\n  dockerfilePath: server/src\n```\n\n#### Branch and tag filtering\n\nWant to only build from specific branches or tags? Builds that are started automatically by a webhook (see [build hooks](#build-hooks) below), can be filtered, based on the name of the branch or tag sent by the webhook. Webhooks that don't match the rules will not cause a build to be scheduled.\n\nMatching rules can be configured with one or more of the following properties:\n\n- **branches**: An array of branch names that should be built\n- **patterns**: An array of JavaScript-compatible regular expressions for matching branch and tag names to be built\n- **tags**: A boolean allowing all tags to be built when set to `true`\n\nThe following example will allow the branches `develop` and `master` to be built, as well as any branch or tag matching the regular expression `v\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+$`, which looks for a version number in the form `v1.0.0`.\n\n```yaml\nredis:\n  registry: dockerhub\n\nsettings:\n  matching:\n    branches:\n      - master\n      - develop\n    patterns:\n      - ^v\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+$\n```\n\nThe following example will allow the `master` branch, plus all tags to be built:\n\n```yaml\nredis:\n  registry: dockerhub\n\nsettings:\n  matching:\n    branches:\n      - master\n    tags: true\n```\n\nNote that filtering only applies to webhook builds, and only when the `matching` options are configured. Builds scheduled using the web UI or the `api/build` endpoint are not affected by these filters.\n\n### Server configuration\n\nRoger will read a `/config.yml` file that you\nneed to mount in the container:\n\n``` yaml\napp: # generic settings\n  url: 'https://builds.yourcompany.com' # optional, just used for logging\n  auth: ~ # authentication turned off by default, see next paragraph\n  defaultRegistry: registry.company.com # the default registry to use, ie. 127.0.0.1:5000\nbuilds:\n  concurrent: 5 # max number of builds to run in parallel, use ~ to disable\n  retry-after: 30 # interval, in seconds, for Roger to check whether it can start queued builds\nauth: # authentication on various providers\n  dockerhub: # these credentials are only useful if you need to push to the dockerhub\n    username: odino # your username on the dockerhub\n    email:    alessandro.nadalin@gmail.com # your...well, you get it\n    password: YOUR_DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD\n  github: YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN # General token to be used to authenticate to clone any project (https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)\nnotifications: # configs to notify of build failures / successes\n  github: # this will create a github status\n    token: '{{ auth.github }}'  # config values can reference other values\n  emailSes: # sends an email through amazon SES\n    accessKey: 1234\n    secret: 5678\n    region: eu-west-1\n    to:\n      - john.doe@gmail.com # a list of people who will be notified\n      - committer # this is a special value that references the email of the commit author\n    from: builds@company.com # sender email (needs to be verified on SES: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-email-addresses.html)\ndocker:\n  client: # here you can specify any option accepted by dockerode (https://github.com/apocas/dockerode#getting-started)\n    # by default, we will try to connect to this socket, that is why we launch roger with -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock\n    socketPath: '/tmp/docker.sock'\n    # you can specify host, port, protocol...\n    host: __gateway__ # this is a special value that will resolve to the gateway through netroute (http://npmjs.org/package/netroute)\n    port: 2375\n    protocol: http\n```\n\n### Configuring auth\n\nRoger comes with no authentication: all its\nroutes are public and everyone with access to\nroger can trigger builds and see everything.\n\nSince everyone has different needs, we want to\nlet you specify the auth mechanism of your\nchoice, based on [passport](http://passportjs.org/).\n\nJust define an auth provider in roger's config:\n\n``` yaml\napp:\n  auth:\n    provider: '/auth/myProvider.js'\n```\n\nAt this point, mount your provider when launching\nthe container with `-v mycode/auth:/auth`: Roger will\ndynamically load your own module and import it in\nthe app.\n\nThe `myProvider.js` module needs to expose a function\nthat accepts an app and register its own auth mechanism:\nit sounds more complicated than it is, so I'll just\nforward you to the [example provider](https://github.com/namshi/roger/blob/master/examples/auth/local.js).\n\n## Use different images for building and running your app\n\nEver felt like your images are too chubby?\n\nDeploying the same image you use for development and building\noften carries expendable `stuff` with it.\n\nAn example might be compass: css-ninjias love\ntheir scss files but we end up with an images full of\nruby we might not really need.\n\nYou can easilly instruct Roger to use a specific\nbuilding image, extract the result and package it up in a slimmer one!\n\nSimply add the `build` section to the fatty project in your `build.yml`\n\n```yml\n  project:\n    build:\n      dockerfile: dockerfile.build\n      extract: /src\n```\n\nRoger will than use `dockerfile.build` as dockerfile for the building image,\nextract the content of `/src` and repack it in a slimmer image as defined\nby the usuale Dockerfile (you need to provide you own build and slim Dockerfile ;)).\n\nFor example this could be your regular `Dockerfile`:\n\n```\nFROM alpine:edge\n\nMAINTAINER you@gmail.com\n\nRUN apk add --update nodejs='=4.1.1-r0' && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*\n\nCOPY . /src\nWORKDIR /src\n\nEXPOSE 8080\n\nCMD [\"node\", \"src/app.js\"]\n```\n\nwhile the `Dockerfile.build` could look like this:\n\n```\nFROM node:latest\n\nMAINTAINER you@gmail.com\n\nRUN apt-get update\nRUN apt-get install -y ruby-full build-essential\nRUN gem install sass compass --no-ri --no-rdoc\n\nRUN npm install -g gulp nodemon\nRUN npm install -g gulp bower\nRUN npm install -g gulp mocha\n\nCOPY . /src\nWORKDIR /src\n\nRUN npm install && \\\n    bower install --allow-root && \\\n    gulp sass\n```\n\nSo that the `build.yml` would look like this:\n\n``` yaml\nmyProject:\n  build:\n    dockerfile: Dockerfile.build\n    extract: /src\n```\n\n## Build hooks\n\nRoger exposes a simple HTTP interface\nand provides integration with some SCM\nprovider, ie. GitHub.\n\n### Github\n\nSimply add a new webhook to your repo at\n`https://github.com/YOU/YOUR_PROJECT/settings/hooks/new`\nand configure it as follows:\n\n![github webhook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namshi/roger/master/bin/images/webhook.png)\n\nRoger will build everytime you push to\ngithub, a new tag is created or you\ncomment on a PR with the text `build please!`.\n\n## Notifications\n\nOnce your build finishes, you can notify\n*someone* about its result (ie. success / failure).\n\n### Github Statuses\n\nThis notification creates a [github status](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/#create-a-status) based on the commit hash.\n> Using github statuses requires that the github user has [write permission](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/) to the repository.\n\n![github status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namshi/roger/master/bin/images/notification-github.png)\n\n``` yaml\nmy-project:\n  notify:\n    - github\n```\n\n### Email (through Amazon SES)\n\nIf you want to receive notifications\nvia email, you can simply configure\nthe `emailSes` handler that will\nsend emails through [Amazon SES](http://aws.amazon.com/ses/).\n\n![ses notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namshi/roger/master/bin/images/notification-ses.png)\n\n``` yaml\nmy-project:\n  branch:       master\n  from:         https://github.com/me/awesome-project\n  notify:\n    - emailSes\n```\n\nand then in roger's `config.yml`:\n\n``` yaml\nnotifications:\n  emailSes:\n    accessKey: 1a2b3c4d5e6f\n    secret: 1a2b3c4d5e6f\n    region: eu-west-1\n    to:\n      - committer\n      - someone@yourcompany.com\n    from: admin@namshi.com\n```\n\nNote that:\n\n* the `from` address needs to be\n[verified on SES](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-email-addresses.html)\n* `committer` is a special value that represents the committer's email\n\n### Notification on Slack\nOnce the build is complete, it pushes a notification to a slack channel mentioned in the config\n![slack channel notification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namshi/roger/master/bin/images/notification-slack.png)\n\nTo enable slack notification for individual projects the build.yml file can be updated with the slack parameter in the notification block:\n\n``` yaml\nmy-project:\n  branch:       master\n  from:         https://github.com/me/awesome-project\n  notify:\n    - slack\n```\n\nfor enabling slack notification for all the projects, the base.yml can be updated as:\n\n```\nnotifications:\n  slack:\n    global: 'true'\n    channel: '#channel-name'\n    icon_emoji: ':slack-emoji:'\n    username: 'Roger'\n```\n\n## Publishing artifacts\n\nRoger provides some ways to upload your build to\nsome supported providers.\n\n### S3\n\nYou can upload stuff from your container to an S3\nbucket by simply specifying the following in your\nproject configuration:\n\n``` yaml\nmyproject:\n  publish:\n    -\n      to: s3\n      copy: /src/build/public/ # this is the path inside the container\n      bucket: my-bucket # name of the s3 bucket\n      bucketPath: initial-path # the initial path, ie. s3://my-bucket/initial-path\n      command: gulp build # optional: a command to run right before publishing (you might wanna build stuff here)\n```\n\nThen just store the s3 credentials in roger's `config.yml`:\n\n``` yaml\npublishers:\n  s3:\n    key: 1a2b3c4d5e6f\n    secret: 1a2b3c4d5e6f\n```\n\nWhat happens is that we're gonna run a container\nwith the image we just built, then copy a directory\noutside of the container (yes, to the host machine)\nand then upload that to S3.\n\n## Hooks\n\nRoger has the concept of hooks, which are\ncommands that you can run at certain steps\nof the build.\n\n### after-build\n\nAfter an image is built, you can run as many\nhooks as you want **in a container running\nthat specific image**; this means that if you\nwant to run the tests of your applications you\nwill most likely configure the project as follows:\n\n``` yaml\nmy-node-app:\n  registry: registry.company.com\n  after-build:\n    - npm test\n```\n\nThat is it! Now, after an image is built, before\ntagging it and sending it to the registry, roger\nwill run `npm test` in your container and, if the\ntests fail, will stop the build.\n\nNeat, ah?\n\n## APIs\n\n### Listing all projects\n\n`/api/projects` will return you the latest\n10 projects that were updated (added on roger,\na build was triggered, etc).\n\nYou can customize the number of projects you will\nget back by adding a `limit` parameter to the\nquery string.\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"projects\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"https://github.com/company/redis__redis-server\",\n            \"alias\": \"redis-server (company/redis)\",\n            \"latest_build\": {\n                \"branch\": \"patch-1\",\n                \"project\": \"https://github.com/company/redis__redis-server\",\n                \"status\": \"passed\",\n                \"id\": \"0715a3b5-43fe-4d07-9705-82641db07c25-redis-server\",\n                \"tag\": \"registry.company.com/redis-server:patch-1\",\n                \"created_at\": \"2015-07-02T08:44:28+00:00\",\n                \"updated_at\": \"2015-07-02T08:45:09+00:00\"\n            }\n        },\n        ...\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Listing all builds\n\n`/api/builds` will return you the latest\n10 builds roger ran. You can customize the\nnumber of builds you will get back by adding\na `limit` parameter to the query string.\n\n### Getting a build\n\n`/api/builds/BUILD_ID` will return you the\ndetails of a build:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"build\": {\n        \"branch\": \"patch-1\",\n        \"project\": \"https://github.com/company/redis__redis\",\n        \"status\": \"passed\",\n        \"id\": \"0715a3b5-43fe-4d07-9705-82641db07c25-redis\",\n        \"tag\": \"registry.company.com/redis:patch-1\",\n        \"created_at\": \"2015-07-02T08:44:28+00:00\",\n        \"updated_at\": \"2015-07-02T08:45:09+00:00\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf you add `/log` at the end of the URL (ie. `/api/builds/1234/log`)\nyou will be streamed the log output of that build:\n\n```\n2015-01-27T19:18:34.810Z - info: [127.0.0.1:5000/redis:patch-1] Scheduled a build of cb5ea16d-5266-4018-b571-954e75b825e0\n2015-01-27T19:18:34.810Z - info: Cloning https://github.com/namshi/redis:patch-1 in /tmp/roger-builds/sources/cb5ea16d-5266-4018-b571-954e75b825e0\n2015-01-27T19:18:34.816Z - info: git clone https://github.com/namshi/redis: Cloning into '/tmp/roger-builds/sources/cb5ea16d-5266-4018-b571-954e75b825e0'...\n\n2015-01-27T19:18:37.274Z - info: [127.0.0.1:5000/redis:patch-1] Created tarball for cb5ea16d-5266-4018-b571-954e75b825e0\n2015-01-27T19:18:37.365Z - info: Build of 127.0.0.1:5000/redis:patch-1 is in progress...\n2015-01-27T19:18:37.365Z - info: [127.0.0.1:5000/redis:patch-1] Step 0 : FROM dockerfile/redis\n\n2015-01-27T19:18:37.365Z - info: [127.0.0.1:5000/redis:patch-1]  ---> c08280595650\n...\n...\n...\n```\n\n### Triggering builds\n\nYou can simply issue a GET request to the endpoint\n`/api/v2/build?repo=REPO_URL&branch=BRANCH`.\n\nFor example, both of these URLs are valid endpoints:\n\n* `/api/build?repo=https://github.com/redis/redis`\n* `/api/build?repo=https://github.com/redis/redis&branch=master`\n\nIf you don't specify a branch, `master`\nwill be used.\n\nThe same endpoint supports `POST` requests as well, `GET`\nshould only really be used for debugging or so\n([here's why](http://www.looah.com/source/view/2284)).\n\nYou can also specify [docker options](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.17/#build-image-from-a-dockerfile) in your request,\nie. if you want the build to run with the `--no-cache` flag\njust call `/api/build?repo=https://github.com/redis/redis&options[nocache]=true`.\n\n## In production\n\nEvery container (even Roger itself) at [Namshi](https://github.com/namshi)\ngets built through Roger: we have been running it, behind our own firewall,\nfor the past 6 months or so and had no issues with it; whenever our engineers\npush to github Roger builds the project and pushes it to our private registry,\noften in a matter of seconds.\n\n## Why did you build this?\n\nGood question, especially since we hate to re-invent the wheel!\n\nRoger was built since, at the very beginning of our experience\nwith Docker, there were no decent SaaS that could run Docker\nbuilds in a matter of seconds: we first tried the DockerHub\nand it could even take up to 15 minutes to get a build done, which was\nfrustrating. We wanted new images to be available in seconds.\nAt the same time, neither Travis-CI, CodeShip nor Drone.io\nseemed to have a tight and nice integration with Docker\n(though some of them have made giant steps over the past few\nmonths so...who knows what we're gonna be using in a year!).\n\nThus, one day, we decided to try [dockerode](https://github.com/apocas/dockerode)\nout and see if we could hack a Docker builder in a couple\nevenings. The idea of running Roger in its own container,\nsharing the docker socket, comes from the\n[nginx proxy container](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy#usage).\n\nAt the beginning, Roger only ran via its APIs: once we\nstarted flirting with the idea of making it public,\nwe decided to take some time off and build a small\nfrontend with ReactJS, as an experiment -- part of the\n[perks of working at Namshi](http://tech.namshi.io/join-us/) ;-)\n\nRoger has been running without problems for a few months,\nand we're pretty happy with it.\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou can easily hack on roger by simply cloning\nthis repository and then running:\n\n```\ndocker-compose build\ndocker-compose run server npm install\ndocker-compose run server bash -c \"cd src/client && npm install && npm run build\"\ndocker-compose up\n```\n\nand you will have the roger server and a simple docker registry\nrunning on your localhost.\n\nWhen you trigger a build, you should see something\nlike:\n\n```\n~  ᐅ docker ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                 COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                              NAMES\n12e1d7e6d260        roger_server:latest   \"nodemon /src/src/in   4 minutes ago       Up 4 minutes        3000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp   roger_server_1\ne3bf2bfa935e        registry:latest       \"docker-registry\"      4 minutes ago       Up 4 minutes        0.0.0.0:5001->5000/tcp             roger_registry_1\n~  ᐅ docker logs -f --tail=0 12e1d7e6d260\n2015-01-23T14:53:29.610Z -
