They address a wide range of topics within the research and practice of science and culture, often through storytelling. The speakers are given a maximum of 18 minutes to present their ideas in the most innovative and engaging ways they can. One can eaisly find all the TED videos [here](https://ted.com/talks).\n\nThis project is aimed at creating a sustainable solution to make TED accessible offline by creating ZIM files providing these videos in a similar manner like online.\n\n\n## Getting started :rocket:\n\n#### Install the dependencies\nMake sure that you have `python3`, `unzip`, `ffmpeg`, `wget` and `curl` installed on your system before running the scraper (otherwise you'll get a warning to install them).\n\n#### Setup the package\nOne can eaisly install the PyPI version but let's setup the source version. Firstly, clone this repository and install the package as given below.\n\n```bash\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n```bash\npython3 setup.py install\n```\n\nThat's it. You can now run `ted2zim` from your terminal\n\n```bash\nted2zim --topics [TOPICS] --name [NAME]\n```\n\nFor the full list of arguments, see [this](ted2zim/entrypoint.py) file or run the following\n```bash\nted2zim --help\n```\n\nExample usage\n```bash\nted2zim --topics=\"augmented reality\" --max-videos-per-topic=10 --debug --name=\"augumented_reality\" --format=mp4 --title=\"Augmented Reality\" --description=\"TED videos in AR category\" --creator=\"TED\" --publisher=\"openzim\" --output=\"output\" --keep --low-quality\n```\n\nThis project can also be run with docker. Use the provided [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) to run it with docker. See steps [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/).\n\n## Features :robot:\nYou can create ZIMs for multiple topics (should be same as given [here](https://ted.com/talks)), choose between different video formats (webm/mp4), different compression rates, and even use an S3 based cache.\n\n#### Want more flexibility? There's a multitool\n`ted2zim-multi` is an extra command available that allows you to do much more with the scraper. It falls back to `ted2zim` if normal commands are passed. It supports creation of multiple ZIMs with single command for both playlists and topics and even getting metadata from a specified JSON file. It supports the following extra arguments -\n\n- `--indiv-zims` - Allows you to create one zim/topic or one zim/playlist\n- `--{name|description|zim-file|title}-format` - Allows you to add custom format for the equivalent `ted2zim` arguments. You can add `{identity}` as a placeholder in these values to get the playlist ID / topic name in it's place (spaces replaced by `-`). You can now also add `{slug}` to get the topic/playlist slug.\n- `--metadata-from` - Path to a JSON file containing the metadata.\n\nShould be of the following format:\n\n```bash\n{\n    \"<playlist-id/topic-name-with-underscores>\": {\n        \"name\": \"sample_name_{identity}\",\n        \"description\": \"Sample description\",\n        \"title\": \"Custom title\",\n        \"zim-file\": \"sample.zim\",\n        \"tags\": \"tag\",\n        \"creator\": \"Yourself\",\n        \"build-dir\": \"/custom_build_dir\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSee `ted2zim-multi --help` for details.\n\n## License :book:\n\n[GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0) or later, see\n[LICENSE](LICENSE) for more details.\n",
