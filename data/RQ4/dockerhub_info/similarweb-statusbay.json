The quickest way to get started with StatusBay is by using K8S. [Get started with StatusBay Helm Chart](https://github.com/similarweb/statusbay-helm).\n2. Deploy your application. If you'd like to adopt all StatusBay features, see available configuration options [in this example](/docs/how-to-use.md).\n\n[See DockerHub registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/similarweb/statusbay)\n\n## Documentation & Guides\n\n* [Developer Guide](/docs/developers/README.md): If you are interested in contributing, read the developer guide.\n* [Working with Multiple Clusters](/docs/clusters/README.md): If you have multiple K8S clusters and you wish to have a unified deployment view, take a look at this guide.\n* [Integrations](/docs/integrations.md): List of StatusBay supported integrations.\n* [External Logging System](/docs/external-logs.md): Ship StatusBay logs to your centralized logging system.\n* [Telemetry metrics](/docs/telemetry.md): StatusBay exposes metrics for you to pick up, see the telemetry read me to get started.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nStatusBay **watcher** subscribes to K8S cluster event stream and watches for resource changes (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE).\nUpon a change, such as new application deployment, it starts monitoring the progress of all the resource kinds (deployment, statefulset, daemonset, etc) associated with that deployment, notifies the relevant persona on success/failure/timeout and provides detailed report through the UI.\n\n**Example Scenario**:\n\nSomeone has deployed an Nginx through Helm or Kubectl.\n```bash\n$ helm install {{NGINX_APP}} .\n\n# OR\n\n$ kubectl create deployment --image nginx my-nginx\n```\n\nThe watcher will immediately start monitoring the deployment named `my-nginx` and report to the user using the notifications channels configured (slack, email, etc).\n\nThe following annotations can be attached to deployment to configure the different features StatusBay has to offer.\n\n#### [Read more on StatusBay deployment configuration annotations](/docs/how-to-use.md)\n\n\n## Built With\n\n* [GO](https://golang.org/).\n* [K8S Client Library](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThank you for your interest in contributing!
