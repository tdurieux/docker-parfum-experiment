  "full_description": "VaaS - Varnish as a Service\n---------------------------\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/allegro/vaas.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/allegro/vaas)\n\nVaaS enables you to manage cluster(s) of Varnish servers from one place, via a web GUI or a REST API. Information about \nyour Varnish servers and their backends, directors and probes is saved into a database. It is then used to automatically \ngenerate and distribute VCLs.\n\n![VaaS logo](docs/documentation/img/vaas_logo.png)\n\n### Why we wrote it\nWe got tired of having to edit VCLs manually, storing them under version control and waiting for puppet to distribute \nthem. As our SOA architecture grew, we found ourselves doing it more and more. So we wrote VaaS. Now each team can \nadminister their service's backends by themselves. And they don't have to wait 30 minutes for puppet to distribute the \nchange. It is applied instantly on all Varnish servers.\n\n### Example\nSee [VaaS documentation](http://vaas.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for examples how to use \n[GUI](http://vaas.readthedocs.org/en/latest/documentation/gui/), \n[API](http://vaas.readthedocs.org/en/latest/documentation/api/) and how to familiarize yourself with VaaS in \na few simple steps using [VaaS in Vagrant](http://vaas.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quick-start/vagrant/). \n\n### Licensing\nVaaS is an application written in Python based on Django and several other libraries. These libraries are Open Source \nand subject to their licenses. VaaS code is published under Apache Version 2.0 License.\n",
