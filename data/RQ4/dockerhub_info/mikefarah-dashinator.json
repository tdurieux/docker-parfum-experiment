  "full_description": "# dashinator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mikefarah/dashinator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mikefarah/dashinator)\ndashinator the daringly delightful dashboard. A node + react + redux replacement for [dashing](https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/master/README.md).\n\nUse it as an information radar for teams. I use it to monitor a bunch of micro-services across several environments, and relevant the CI builds and deployments. Because there are so many things to monitor, I don't want to clutter the dashboard making it noisy and hard to read. Instead, the dashboard only reports on failures for Production, Test environments and the CI.\n\nCurrently it supports Bamboo, happy for pull requests to accept other CI tools too :)\n\n## Usage\n\n```\ncat myTeamsConfig.yaml | docker run -i -p 3000:3000 mikefarah/dashinator -\n```\n\nThen browse to http://localhost:3000\n\n## Example config YAML\n\n```yaml\nproductionEnvironment:\n  - name: http listener\n    url: http://localhost:9999/health_check\n\ntestEnvironments:\n  - name: DEV http listener\n    url: http://localhost:9999/health_check\n  - name: QA http listener\n    url: http://localhost:9999/health_check\n\nbamboo:\n  baseUrl: https://bamboo.com\n  requestOptions:\n    strictSSL: false\n    auth:\n      user: user\n      password: password\n  plans:\n      - AWESOME-PLAN\n```\n\nThe health_check endpoints are assumed to return a successful HTTP response code if the service is healthy (successful as defined by node's request library).\n\ndashinator will poll the services and bamboo every 20 seconds and update the dashboard accordingly.\n\n\n## Ignore self signed certificates\n\nSet the NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED environment variable to 0.\n\ne.g:\n\n```\ncat myTeamsConfig.yaml | docker run -i -p 3000:3000 -e NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 mikefarah/dashinator -\n```",
