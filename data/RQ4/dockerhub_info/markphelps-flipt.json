  "full_description": "Flipt is an on-prem flag application that allows you to run experiments across services in **your** environment.\n\nFlipt can be deployed within your existing infrastructure so that you don't have to worry about your information being sent to a third party or the latency required to communicate across the internet.\n\n## Features\n\n* Fast. Written in Go. Optimized for performance\n* Stand alone, easy to run and configure\n* Ability to create advanced distribution rules to target segments of users\n* Native [GRPC](https://grpc.io/) client SDKs to integrate with your applications\n* Simple REST API\n* Modern UI and debug console\n* Support for multiple databases\n\n## Values\n\n* **Security** - HTTPS support. No data leaves your servers and you don't have to open your systems to the outside world to communicate with Flipt. It all runs within your existing infrastructure.\n* **Speed** - Since Flipt is co-located with your existing services, you do not have to communicate across the internet which can add excessive latency and slow down your applications.\n* **Simplicity** - Flipt is a single binary with no external dependencies by default.\n* **Privacy** - No telemetry data is collected or sent by Flipt. Ever.\n\n## Usecases\n\n* Use simple on/off feature flags to toggle functionality in your applications\n* Rollout features to a subset of your audience\n* Use advanced segmentation to target and serve users based on custom properties that you define\n\n## Try It\n\n[![Try in PWD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/play-with-docker/stacks/master/assets/images/button.png)](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/?stack=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markphelps/flipt/master/docker-compose.yml)\n\nTry Flipt out yourself with Docker:\n\n```bash\n‚ùØ docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 9000:9000 markphelps/flipt:latest\n```\n\nFlipt UI will now be reachable at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080).\n\nFor more permanent methods of running Flipt, see the [Installation](https://flipt.io/docs/installation/) section.\n\n## Author\n\n* Twitter: [@mark_a_phelps](https://twitter.com/mark_a_phelps)\n* Email: _hi@markphelps.me_",
