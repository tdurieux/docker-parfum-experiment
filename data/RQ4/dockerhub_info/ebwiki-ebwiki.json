After seeing the video, a group of Black technologists had the idea of a site where information on each encounter could be stored and recorded. This would help show both the frequency with which this occurs as well as the way bias affects the proceedings.\n\nOur idea, EBWiki, is designed to highlight not only the original incident between law enforcement and victims but also what happens to the family, police officers, and communities afterwards. Our goal is to become the most comprehensive resource on people of color killed by law enforcement in the United States and Canada.  Our hope is that, by shedding light on these incidents, we will move and empower others to come together to create and enact solutions.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAll developers are welcome to contribute to the codebase.  For general information on contributing, consult [this guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) on developing for EBWiki.\n\nWe ask that, if possible, you address issues that are labelled `quick fix` first, followed by those marked as `high priority`.\n\nAdditionally, take care to note when an issue is one of several (e.g., 1 of 7, 2 of 3, etc).  Those issues are part of a project or milestone (indicated on the right side under the label), and clicking on the project or milestone should take you to a list of all of the issues.  Please note that those must be completed and merged in order.\n\nIf this is your first open source contribution, welcome!  We're glad that you chose to get started with us.  You can find some good first issues labelled exactly that, `good first issue`.\n\nAll contributors are expected to adhere to our code of conduct, which can be found [here](docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  Thank you for your contribution - details on our stack can be found below.\n\n### Development\n\nInstructions on setting up a local development environment can be found [here](docs/SETUP_LOCALLY.md).\n\nIn general, contributors will use the following languages, frameworks, and technologies:\n\n* [Ruby 2.6.5](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)\n* [Rails 5.0.7](http://rubyonrails.org/)\n* [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)\n* [Postgres 9.4](https://www.postgresql.org/) or higher\n* [Redis](https://redis.io/)\n* [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)\n* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)\n\n\n### Testing\n\nWe use [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails), [shoulda-matchers](http://matchers.shoulda.io/), and [FactoryBot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot) for our tests.  You can run the tests locally with the following commands:\n\n```\nrspec spec/\n```\n\nMore information on how to use RSpec, shoulda-matchers, and FactoryBot can be found at the links above.\n\nWe also use [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) as part of our continous integration process in Travis.  To run Rubocop locally, enter\n\n```\nrubocop\n```\n\n## Contributors\n\nThank you to all of our contributors.
