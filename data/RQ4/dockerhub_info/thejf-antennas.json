  "full_description": "![Antennas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheJF/antennas/master/docs/images/antennas-logo.png)\n\nA JavaScript port of [tvhProxy](https://github.com/jkaberg/tvhProxy) which is a program that translates the Tvheadend API to emulate a HDHomeRun API. This is particularly useful to connect [Plex's DVR feature](https://www.plex.tv/features/live-tv-dvr/) to Tvheadend.\n\n## Getting it running\n\n### Tvheadend Configuration\nTo be able to stream from Tvheadend through Plex, you need to set up an anonymous user in Tvheadend that has streaming rights. You can do this in the users section, by creating a user `*`:\n\n![Example configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheJF/antennas/master/docs/images/tvheadend-config.png)\n\n### Using binaries\n\nHead over to the [release](https://github.com/TheJF/antennas/releases) section and download the binary for your platform. It will come with a `config/config.yml` that you can edit to reflect your setup, and you can simply run `antennas` in the console and the server will start up and start proxying Tvheadend over to Plex!\n\n### Run locally using Node\n\nRight now, due to Docker networking issues, the best way to get this working is by running it directly through node.\n\n* [Set up Node locally](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)\n* Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/TheJF/antennas.git` or [download the source code directly from releases](https://github.com/TheJF/antennas/releases) and extract it\n* Run `yarn install` or `npm install` to install dependencies\n* In the directory where it was extracted, run `node index.js` (Note, Node version must be above 7)\n\nTo run it as a daemon:\n`node index.js >/dev/null 2>&1 &`\n\n### Docker\n\nAnother way to get it running is to run it using Docker. Note that some functionality is currently not quite working when hosting this as a Docker container, namely, discovery from Plex. But with that warning, if you so choose to continue using Docker, the instructions are below.\n\nTo start a Docker container running Antennas, run the command below. Note you must replace the `ANTENNAS_URL` and `TVHEADEND_URL` value to match your setup:\n`docker run -p 5004:5004 -e ANTENNAS_URL=http://x.x.x.x:5004 -e TVHEADEND_URL=http://replace:me@x.x.x.x:9981 thejf/antennas`\n\nTo view if the configurations have been passed correctly, you can point your browser to where you are hosting Antennas (in the above example, it would be `http://x.x.x.x:5004` but this is a placeholder address that __needs__ to be changed) and you should see a summary of your configurations on the page:\n\n![Example landing page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheJF/antennas/master/docs/images/example-index.png)\n\nAlternatively, you can set it with all the available environment variables:\n```\n  docker create --name=antennas\n    -e ANTENNAS_URL=http://x.x.x.x:5004\n    -e TVHEADEND_URL=http://replace:me@x.x.x.x:9981\n    -e TUNER_COUNT=6\n    -p 5004:5004\n    thejf/antennas\n```\n\nAnd then `docker start antennas`\n\nOr, you can try by mounting a volume, set by yourself in path/to/config, that will need a config.yml to work. Example of a config.yml is [available here](https://github.com/TheJF/antennas/blob/master/config/config.yml), or below:\n```\ntvheadend_url: http://replace:me@x.x.x.x:9981\nantennas_url: http://x.x.x.x:5004\ntuner_count: 6\n```\n\n* `docker create --name=antennas -v <path/to/config>:/antennas/config -p 5004:5004 thejf/antennas`\n* Set up `config.yml` (see configuration instructions [here](https://github.com/TheJF/antennas#configuration)) where you pointed the config volume (what you replaced `<path/to/config>` with\n* Finally, `docker start antennas`\n\n## Configuration\n\nAntennas can be configured either via the config.yml or environment variables. Environment variables take precedence over the config.yml.\n\n#### config.yml\n\nAntennas will look for three values inside a `config/config.yml` file. They are:\n\n* `tvheadend_url`: This is the path to your Tvheadend setup, with username, password, and port. Plex doesn't like `localhost` so it's best to find your own local IP and put this in if Tvheadend and Plex are running on the same network. For example: `http://user:pass@192.168.0.1:9981`\n* `tuner_count`: This is for the number of tuners in Tvheadend.\n\n#### Environment variables\n\nIf you want to set environment variables instead of modifying the config.yml, you can do so. The environment variable names are the same than the config.yml, except capitalized. So, `TVHEADEND_URL` and `TUNER_COUNT`.\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.
