Please use this module responsibly.\n\nInstallation\n-------------\n``pip install blinkpy``\n\nInstalling Development Version\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTo install the current development version, perform the following steps.  Note that the following will create a blinkpy directory in your home area:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ cd ~\n    $ git clone https://github.com/fronzbot/blinkpy.git\n    $ cd blinkpy\n    $ rm -rf build dist\n    $ python3 setup.py bdist_wheel\n    $ pip3 install --upgrade dist/*.whl\n\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to this library, please read the `contributing instructions <https://github.com/fronzbot/blinkpy/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`__.\n\nFor more information on how to use this library, please `read the docs <https://blinkpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.\n\nPurpose\n-------\nThis library was built with the intention of allowing easy communication with Blink camera systems, specifically to support the `Blink component <https://home-assistant.io/components/blink>`__ in `homeassistant <https://home-assistant.io/>`__.\n\nQuick Start\n=============\nThe simplest way to use this package from a terminal is to call ``Blink.start()`` which will prompt for your Blink username and password and then log you in.  In addition, http requests are throttled internally via use of the ``Blink.refresh_rate`` variable, which can be set at initialization and defaults to 30 seconds.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from blinkpy.blinkpy import Blink\n   \n    blink = Blink()\n    blink.start()\n\n\nThis flow will prompt you for your username and password.  Once entered, if you likely will need to send a 2FA key to the blink servers (this pin is sent to your email address).  When you receive this pin, enter at the prompt and the Blink library will proceed with setup.\n\nStarting blink without a prompt\n-------------------------------\nIn some cases, having an interactive command-line session is not desired.  In this case, you will need to set the ``Blink.auth.no_prompt`` value to ``True``.  In addition, since you will not be prompted with a username and password, you must supply the login data to the blink authentication handler.  This is best done by instantiating your own auth handler with a dictionary containing at least your username and password.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from blinkpy.blinkpy import Blink\n    from blinkpy.auth import Auth\n\n    blink = Blink()\n    # Can set no_prompt when initializing auth handler\n    auth = Auth({\"username\": <your username>, \"password\": <your password>}, no_prompt=True)\n    blink.auth = auth\n    blink.start()\n\n\nSince you will not be prompted for any 2FA pin, you must call the ``blink.auth.send_auth_key`` function.  There are two required parameters: the ``blink`` object as well as the ``key`` you received from Blink for 2FA:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    auth.send_auth_key(blink, <your key>)\n    blink.setup_post_verify()\n\n\nSupplying credentials from file\n--------------------------------\nOther use cases may involved loading credentials from a file.  This file must be ``json`` formatted and contain a minimum of ``username`` and ``password``.  A built in function in the ``blinkpy.helpers.util`` module can aid in loading this file.  Note, if ``no_prompt`` is desired, a similar flow can be followed as above.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from blinkpy.blinkpy import Blink\n    from blinkpy.auth import Auth\n    from blinkpy.helpers.util import json_load\n\n    blink = Blink()\n    auth = Auth(json_load(\"<File Location>\"))\n    blink.auth = auth\n    blink.start()\n\n\nSaving credentials\n-------------------\nThis library also allows you to save your credentials to use in future sessions.  Saved information includes authentication tokens as well as unique ids which should allow for a more streamlined experience and limits the frequency of login requests.  This data can be saved as follows (it can then be loaded by following the instructions above for supplying credentials from a file):\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    blink.save(\"<File location>\")\n\n\nGetting cameras\n----------------\nCameras are instantiated as individual ``BlinkCamera`` classes within a ``BlinkSyncModule`` instance.  All of your sync modules are stored within the ``Blink.sync`` dictionary and can be accessed using the name of the sync module as the key (this is the name of your sync module in the Blink App).\n\nThe below code will display cameras and their available attributes:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    for name, camera in blink.cameras.items():\n      print(name)                   # Name of the camera\n      print(camera.attributes)      # Print available attributes of camera\n\n\nThe most recent images and videos can be accessed as a bytes-object via internal variables.  These can be updated with calls to ``Blink.refresh()`` but will only make a request if motion has been detected or other changes have been found.  This can be overridden with the ``force`` flag, but this should be used for debugging only since it overrides the internal request throttling.\n\n.. code:: python\n    \n    camera = blink.cameras['SOME CAMERA NAME']\n    blink.refresh(force=True)  # force a cache update USE WITH CAUTION\n    camera.image_from_cache.raw  # bytes-like image object (jpg)\n    camera.video_from_cache.raw  # bytes-like video object (mp4)\n\nThe ``blinkpy`` api also allows for saving images and videos to a file and snapping a new picture from the camera remotely:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    camera = blink.cameras['SOME CAMERA NAME']\n    camera.snap_picture()       # Take a new picture with the camera\n    blink.refresh()             # Get new information from server\n    camera.image_to_file('/local/path/for/image.jpg')\n    camera.video_to_file('/local/path/for/video.mp4')\n\n\nArming Blink\n-------------\nMethods exist to arm/disarm the sync module, as well as enable/disable motion detection for individual cameras.  This is done as follows:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # Arm a sync module\n    blink.sync[\"SYNC MODULE NAME\"].arm = True\n\n    # Disarm a sync module\n    blink.sync[\"SYNC MODULE NAME\"].disarm = False\n\n    # Print arm status of a sync module - a system refresh should be performed first\n    blink.refresh()\n    sync = blink.sync[\"SYNC MODULE NAME\"]\n    print(f\"{sync.name} status: {sync.arm}\")\n\nSimilar methods exist for individual cameras:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   camera = blink.cameras[\"SOME CAMERA NAME\"]\n\n   # Enable motion detection on a camera\n   camera.arm = True\n\n   # Disable motion detection on a camera\n   camera.arm = False\n\n   # Print arm status of a sync module - a system refresh should be performed first\n   blink.refresh()\n   print(f\"{camera.name} status: {camera.arm}\")\n\n\nDownload videos\n----------------\nYou can also use this library to download all videos from the server.  In order to do this, you must specify a ``path``.  You may also specifiy a how far back in time to go to retrieve videos via the ``since=`` variable (a simple string such as ``\"2017/09/21\"`` is sufficient), as well as how many pages to traverse via the ``stop=`` variable.  Note that by default, the library will search the first ten pages which is sufficient in most use cases.  Additionally, you can specify one or more cameras via the ``camera=`` property.  This can be a single string indicating the name of the camera, or a list of camera names.  By default, it is set to the string ``'all'`` to grab videos from all cameras. If you are downloading many items, setting the ``delay`` parameter is advised in order to throttle sequential calls to the API. By default this is set to ``1`` but can be any integer representing the number of seconds to delay between calls.\n\nExample usage, which downloads all videos recorded since July 4th, 2018 at 9:34am to the ``/home/blink`` directory with a 2s delay between calls:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    blink.download_videos('/home/blink', since='2018/07/04 09:34', delay=2)\n\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://github.com/fronzbot/blinkpy/workflows/build/badge.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/fronzbot/blinkpy/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild\n.. |Coverage Status| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/fronzbot/blinkpy/branch/dev/graph/badge.svg\n    :target: https://codecov.io/gh/fronzbot/blinkpy\n.. |PyPi Version| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/blinkpy.svg\n    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/blinkpy\n.. |Docs| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/blinkpy/badge/?version=latest\n   :target: http://blinkpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest   \n.. |Codestyle| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/psf/black\n",
