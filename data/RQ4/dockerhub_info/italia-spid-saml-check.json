It includes:\n - a tool based on Tox (_`specs-compliance-tests`_) to check the SPID specifications compliance\n - a web application (_`spid-validator`_) that provides an easy to use interface\n - a web application (_`spid-demo`_) that acts as a test IdP for demo purpose\n - an extension for Google Chrome that intercepts the request (deprecated)\n\n*SPID SAML Check* has been developed and is maintained by AgID - Agenzia per l'Italia Digitale\n\n## How to build with Docker\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/italia/spid-saml-check.git\ncd spid-saml-check\n$ docker build -t spid-saml-check .\n```\n\n## How to run with Docker\n\n```\n$ docker run -t -i -p 8080:8080 spid-saml-check\n```\n\n## How to use it as a *SPID Validator*\n\nThe application spid-validator, if invoked as a web application *as is*, provides \"basic\", formal validation of a Service Provider's SAML metadata.\n\nIn order to unleash the **full** set of SPID compliance tests (the proper *SPID Validator*), retrieve the metadata of *SPID Validator* at https://localhost:8080/metadata.xml and configure it on as a new Identity Provider (IdP) under your Service Provider (SP) implementation.\n\nWhen used in this fashion, the *SPID Validator* can be invoked as an IdP from your SP, listing 300+ individual controls, divided into 7 families:\n * 4 families for the formal validation of the SP **metadata** (already described);\n * 3 families for the formal validation of the SP's SAML **request**;\n * 1 family (111 controls) for *interactively* validating the SP behaviour to SAML **response**s from IdP's.\n\nTo use the *SPID Validator* the AuthnRequest are thus sent from your SP, loggin in to Validator with credentials __validator__ / __validator__\n\n\n### Usage steps\n\n- Copy spid-validator metadata to the SP you want to test with.\n  spid-validator can be downloaded at: [https://localhost:8080/metadata.xml](https://localhost:8080/metadata.xml)\n  ````\n  wget https://localhost:8080/metadata.xml -O /path/to/your/sp/metadata/folder/spid-saml-check-metadata.xml\n  ````\n\n- Start authentication request connecting to your SP, the AuthnRequest would be created and sent to spid-saml-check.\n  You should access to a page like shown in the following picture\n  \n  <img src=\"doc/img/login.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"login page\" />\n  \n\n- Submit __validator__ / __validator__ as credential\n- You would see the SAML2 Authn Request made from your SP\n\n  <img src=\"doc/img/2.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"authn request page\" />\n  \n\n- Click on Metadata -> Download and submit your SP metadata url.<br/>\n  **Warning**: If your SP is on your localhost, please use your host Docker IP and not \"localhost\"!\n\n  <img src=\"doc/img/3.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"metadata download page\" />\n  \n- Now you'll be able to execute all the tests, in order of appareance: Metadata, Request and Response.\n- To check a Response, from Response section, select in the scroll menu the test you want to execute, then mark it as done and if successful\n\n  <img src=\"doc/img/4a.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"response select page\" />\n\n\n## How to use it as a *SPID Demo*\n\nThe application spid-demo runs at: [https://localhost:8080/demo](https://localhost:8080/demo)\n\n<img src=\"doc/img/demo_idp_index.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"demo index page\" />\n   \n   \nTest users of spid-demo that can be used are listed at: [https://localhost:8080/demo/users](https://localhost:8080/demo/users)\n\n<img src=\"doc/img/demo_idp_users.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"demo users page\" />\n\n\n<h3>Usage steps</h3>\n\n- Copy spid-demo metadata to the SP you want to test with.\n  spid-demo metadata can be downloaded at: [https://localhost:8080/demo/metadata.xml](https://localhost:8080/demo/metadata.xml)\n  ````\n  wget https://localhost:8080/demo/metadata.xml -O /path/to/your/sp/metadata/folder/spid-demo.xml\n  ````\n\n- Go to https://localhost:8080 to register metadata of your SP on spid-validator.\n  You should access to a page like shown in the following picture\n  \n  <img src=\"doc/img/login.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"login page\" />\n  \n  \n- Submit __validator__/ __validator__ as credential\n\n- Click on Metadata -> Download and submit your SP metadata url.<br/>\n  **Warning**: If your SP is on your localhost, please use your host Docker IP and not \"localhost\"!\n  \n  <img src=\"doc/img/demo_download_metadata_sp.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"download metadata page\" />\n  \n\n- Send an authn request to spid-demo in order to use Demo environment\n\n  <img src=\"doc/img/demo_idp.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"demo idp\" />\n",
