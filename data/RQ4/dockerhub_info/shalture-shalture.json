  "full_description": "**Development of Shaltúre has been discontinued and we recommend that you use\n[Atheme](https://github.com/atheme/atheme) instead, which is under active\ndevelopment again.** This repository is preserved for historical reasons. There\nmay be code or proposed features that have not been ported over to Atheme yet.\n\n---\n\n## Shaltúre\n\nShaltúre is a set of services for IRC networks designed for large IRC networks \nwith high scalability requirements.  It is relatively mature software, with \nsome code and design derived from another package called Shrike, and is a fork \nof a dying services package named Atheme.\n\nShaltúre's behavior is tunable using modules and a highly detailed \nconfiguration file. Almost all behavior can be changed at deployment time just \nby editing the configuration.\n\nIf you are running this code from Git, you should read `GIT-Access` for \ninstructions on how to fully check out the Shaltúre tree, as it is spread \nacross a few repositories.\n\n## Building\n\nWhatever you do, make sure you do *not* install Shaltúre into the same location \nas the source. Shaltúre will default to installing in `$HOME/shalture`, so make \nsure you plan accordingly for this.\n\n    $ git submodule update --init\n    $ ./configure\n    $ make\n    $ make install\n\nIf you're still lost, read [INSTALL](INSTALL) or [GIT-Access](GIT-Access) for \nhints.\n\n## Contact Us\n\n__Be sure to read [the FAQ](doc/FAQ.md) as well.__\n\n * [GitHub: shalture/shalture](https://github.com/shalture/shalture)\n * [IRC: chat.freenode.net, #shalture](ircs://chat.freenode.net:6697/shalture) ([webchat](https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net:+6697/shalture))\n",
