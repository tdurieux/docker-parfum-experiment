  "full_description": "## An MS-DOS emulator for the web.\n\nDOSee is a front-end for an [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) emulation ecosystem to use on the web. The text-based MS-DOS was the dominant personal computer platform for much of the 1980s. Up until the mid-1990s before being superseded by Microsoft Windows. Emulating this platform allows tens of thousands of games, demos and applications from this era to run on a web browser both online or offline as a desktop web-app!\n\nDOSee is only a user interface and installation process for an incredible emulation ecosystem. Many remarkable people created it over many years. DOSee itself is a fork of [The Emularity](https://github.com/db48x/emularity) project started by the Internet Archive. [EM-DOSBox](https://github.com/dreamlayers/em-dosbox/), the core of this emulation, is a JavaScript port of [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com), the world's most popular MS-DOS emulator.\n\n## Demo\n\nA live demo that also shows the PWA and offline abilities.\n\nhttps://dosee.link/\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name dosee_app -i -p 8086:80 bengarrett/dosee\n```\n\nPoint a web browser to http://localhost:8086\n\n## Removal\n\n```bash\ndocker container rm dosee_app\ndocker image rm bengarrett/dosee\n```\n\n## Source\n\nhttps://github.com/bengarrett/DOSee\n\n",
