We develop features in different branches ``feature/*`` or ``bugfix/*`` appending\nwith the issue key of GitHub.\n\nCrafting releases is done at the ``release/1.1.x`` branches. The branch is created from the master at the moment the freeze moment goes in.\nOnly bug fixes are accepted to be merged into the release/* or master branches (and merged into release again), name these branches ``bugfix/ISSUE-ID``.\n\nAfter releasing (from the release branch) it gets a version tag. From this point there is no way back, new bug releases will be crafted\nfrom the release branch (``release/0.1.x`` for example).\n\nVisualization of our current release schedule can be found here: `Release Schedule <https://github.com/PyPlanet/PyPlanet/projects/3>`_\n\nVersioning\n----------\n\nAll PyPlanet versions bellow 1.0.0 are not using semantic versioning.\nAfter 1.0.0, there is a strict semantic versioning (v2) versioning policy in use.\n\nContributions\n-------------\n\nPull requests and issues are more then welcome.\nPlease open a ticket before a pull request if you are not yet sure how to solve or want opinions before your implementation.
