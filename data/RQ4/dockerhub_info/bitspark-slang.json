It consists of the YAML-based Slang exchange format, the **Slang daemon** and the [Slang UI](https://github.com/Bitspark/slang-ui).\n\n## About Slang daemon\n\nSlang daemon is the service which serves the user web interface (Slang UI) and runs all your operators.\nYou don't need anything else to start working with Slang, so this here is the place to start.\n\n## How to install\n\nIf you want to run Slang, you can simply download the [latest release](https://github.com/Bitspark/slang/releases/latest), unpack and run it. We have binaries for Windows, Linux and MacOS.\n\n### Compile it yourself\n\nIf you rather want to compile it yourself, you first need to install [Go](https://golang.org/).\n\nAfter you have set up Go and cloned the repository, switch to the root directory and run\n\n`go get -v ./...`\n\nThis will fetch all the dependencies. After that, run\n\n`go build -o slangd ./cmd/slangd` (on Windows: `go build -o slangd.exe ./cmd/slangd`)\n\nThat's it! Now you just need to run `slangd` (on Windows: `slangd.exe`) and Slang will take care of the rest such as downloading the UI and standard library.\n\n## Links\n\n- [TrySlang website](http://tryslang.com)\n- [Slang UI repository](https://github.com/Bitspark/slang-ui)\n- [Bitspark website](https://bitspark.de)\n",
