  "full_description": "# telewater\n\nA telegram bot that applies watermark on images, gifs and videos.\n\nGitHub https://github.com/aahnik/telewater\n\nPyPI https://pypi.org/project/telewater\n\n## Features\n\n- **Fast** because it is made using async libraries.\n- **Simple** to use.\n- Any one who uses an instance of the bot will have to use the same watermark and position. This is meant to be used by **single person/organization** (by only you or your team), as configuration is global.\n- **No database** connection required.\n- It **does not store media** (photos/videos/gifs) on the server. Media is deleted immediately after the watermarked version is sent to the user.\n\n# Read more at https://github.com/aahnik/telewater/wiki/Install-and-run-using-docker\n",
