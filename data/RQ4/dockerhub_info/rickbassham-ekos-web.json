  "full_description": "# ekos-web\n\nA simple web server and client that listens for a connection from KStars Ekos\nand provides an easy way to keep track of your astrophotography session from a\nsmall screen.\n\nYou can now control simple things in Ekos, like capturing a preview image, start/stop\nguiding, start/stop auto focus, sovle the current view, park/unpark the mount.\n\n```bash\ndocker pull rickbassham/ekos-web:latest\ndocker run -p 3000:3000 -it rickbassham/ekos-web:latest\n```\n\n\nAfter you have it running, you can visit http://localhost:3000 to view the page.\n\n![ekos-web](https://github.com/rickbassham/ekos-web/raw/master/docs/main.png)\n\nNow launch KStars and Ekos as usual, but now you'll need to connect to KStars Live\nin offline mode.\n\n![ekos](https://github.com/rickbassham/ekos-web/raw/master/docs/ekos.png)\n\n![ekos](https://github.com/rickbassham/ekos-web/raw/master/docs/ekos-live.png)\n\nThe username and password you use here don't matter, they are ignored by this app.\n\nNow connect to you equipment in Ekos as usual and start your astrophotography\nsession.\n\nYou can keep an eye on your equipment now on your smartphone or tablet by browsing to your\nimaging computer's address. For me, it would be http://rick-astrobuntupi:3000.\n\nHere are a few more shots with examples.\n\n![ekos-web](https://github.com/rickbassham/ekos-web/raw/master/docs/capture.png)\n![ekos-web](https://github.com/rickbassham/ekos-web/raw/master/docs/align.png)\n![ekos-web](https://github.com/rickbassham/ekos-web/raw/master/docs/focus.png)\n![ekos-web](https://github.com/rickbassham/ekos-web/raw/master/docs/guide.png)\n![ekos-web](https://github.com/rickbassham/ekos-web/raw/master/docs/mount.png)\n![ekos-web](https://github.com/rickbassham/ekos-web/raw/master/docs/logs.png)\n",
