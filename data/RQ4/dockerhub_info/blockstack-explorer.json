To run the explorer locally, you can clone this repo and install the dependencies needed. Make sure you have `yarn` installed.\n\n```sh\nyarn\n```\n\n### Env variables\n\nThe application needs a couple of env variables to work properly:\n\n```\nMOCKNET_API_SERVER=https://crashy-stacky.zone117x.com\nTESTNET_API_SERVER=https://stacks-node-api.blockstack.org\n```\n\n### Run in development mode\n\nTo build and run the application, you can run this yarn task which will launch the application at http://localhost:3000.\n\n```sh\nyarn dev\n```\n\n### Using a local mocknet\n\nThe Stacks Explorer connects to the [Stacks Blockchain](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain) via an API server found here: [`stacks-blockchain-sidecar`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain-sidecar).\nThe Explorer can connect and switch between a few different versions of the network: testnet, mocknet, and a local instance. To run a local instance of the Sidecar API, [please read this](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain-sidecar/blob/master/readme.md#quick-start).\nOnce you have the Sidecar API running, it should be located at `http://localhost:3999`. You can then from within your local version of the Explorer switch between the three network options:\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blockstack/explorer/master/localhost-switch.gif\" alt=\"Switching networks in the explorer'\"  width=30% height=30%>\n\n\n### Building for production\n\nTo build for production, run `yarn build` which will run the default next.js build task.",
