  "full_description": ".. epigraph::\n\n  Truth cannot penetrate a closed mind. If all places in the universe are in\n  the Aleph, then all stars, all lamps, all sources of light are in it, too.\n\n  -- `The Aleph <http://www.phinnweb.org/links/literature/borges/aleph.html>`_,\n  Jorge Luis Borges\n\n.. figure:: https://api.travis-ci.org/alephdata/aleph.png\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/alephdata/aleph/\n   :alt: Build Status\n\n**Aleph** is a tool for indexing large amounts of both unstructured (PDF, Word,\nHTML) and structured (CSV, XLS, SQL) data for easy browsing and search. It is\nbuilt with investigative reporting as a primary use case. Aleph allows\ncross-referencing mentions of well-known entities (such as people and\ncompanies) against watchlists, e.g. from prior research or public datasets.\n\nHere's some key features:\n\n* Web-based UI for search across large document and data sets.\n* Watchlist editor for making custom sets of entities to be tracked.\n* Equal support for structured (i.e. tabular) and unstructured (i.e. textual)\n  sources.\n* Importers include a local filesystem traverser, web crawlers and a SQL query\n  importer.\n* Document entity tagger (regular expressions-based, and optionally using NLP).\n* Support for OCR, unpacking Zip/RAR/Tarballs, language and encoding detection.\n* Entity watchlist importers for `OpenSanctions <http://opensanctions.org/>`_.\n* OAuth authorization and access control on a per-source and per-watchlist\n  basis.\n* Excel export for search result sets.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe documentation for Aleph is available at\n`aleph.readthedocs.io <http://aleph.readthedocs.io/>`_.\nFeel free to edit the source files in the ``docs`` folder and send pull\nrequests for improvements.\n\nTo build the documentation, run ``make docs``\n\nYou'll find the resulting HTML files in /build/docs/html.\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nAleph is used by multiple organisations, including Code for Africa, OCCRP and\nOpenOil. For coordination, the following mailing list exists:\n`aleph-search <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/aleph-search>`_\n\nIf you find any errors or issues using Aleph please\n`file an issue on GitHub <https://github.com/alephdata/aleph/issues/new>`_ or\ncontact the mailing list.\n",
