Read more about it in [Security](#security).\n\n## Documentation:\n\n* Setup\n  * [Installation and Startup][installation-and-startup]\n  * [Runtime Environment][runtime-environment]\n* Advanced\n  * [Inputs And Outputs][inputs-and-outputs]\n  * [Gateway Configuration][gateway-configuration]\n  * [TLS Certificates and HTTPS][tls-and-https]\n  * [Two Factor Authentication][two-fa]\n* More\n  * [Troubleshooting][troubleshooting]\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=603n4xV26S0\">\n    <img src=\"https://github.com/Voyz/voyz_public/blob/master/ibeam_promo_vidA_A01.gif?raw=true\" alt=\"IBeam showcase gif\" title=\"IBeam showcase gif\" width=\"500\"/>\n</a>\n\n## Quick start\n\n### Installation\n\n#### Docker Image (Recommended):\n```posh\ndocker pull voyz/ibeam\n```\n\n#### Standalone:\n```posh\npip install ibeam\n```\n\n### Startup\n\n#### Docker Image (Recommended):\n```posh\ndocker run --env IBEAM_ACCOUNT=your_account123 --env IBEAM_PASSWORD=your_password123 -p 5000:5000 voyz/ibeam\n```\n\n#### docker-compose:\n\nCreate a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following contents:\n\n```yaml\nversion: \"2.1\"\n\nservices:\n  ibeam:\n    image: voyz/ibeam\n    container_name: ibeam\n    env_file:\n      - env.list\n    ports:\n      - 5000:5000\n    network_mode: bridge # Required due to clientportal.gw IP whitelist\n    restart: 'no' # Prevents IBEAM_MAX_FAILED_AUTH from being exceeded\n```\n\nCreate an `env.list` file in the same directory with the following contents:\n\n```posh\nIBEAM_ACCOUNT=your_account123\nIBEAM_PASSWORD=your_password123\n```\n\nRun the following command:\n\n```posh\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\n#### Standalone:\n\n```posh\npython ibeam_starter.py\n```\n\n----\nOnce started, verify the Gateway is running by calling:\n```posh\ncurl -X GET \"https://localhost:5000/v1/api/one/user\" -k\n```\n\nRead more in [Installation and Startup][installation-and-startup].\n\n## <a name=\"how-ibeam-works\"></a>How does IBeam work?\n\nIn a standard startup IBeam performs the following:\n\n1. **Copy inputs** from the Inputs Directory to Gateway's `root` folder (if provided).\n1. **Ensure the Gateway is running** by calling the tickle endpoint. If not:\n    1. Start the Gateway in a new shell.\n1. **Ensure the Gateway has an active session that is  authenticated** by calling the tickle endpoint. If not:\n    1. Create a new Chrome Driver instance using `selenium`.\n    1. Start a virtual display using `pyvirtualdisplay`.\n    1. Access the Gateway's authentication website.\n    1. Once loaded, input username and password and submit the form.\n    1. Wait for the login confirmation and quit the website.\n    1. Verify once again if Gateway is running and authenticated.\n1. **Start the maintenance**, attempting to keep the Gateway alive and authenticated. Will repeat login if finds no active session or the session is not authenticated. \n\n\n## <a name=\"security\"></a>Security\nPlease feel free to suggest improvements to the security risks currently present in IBeam and the Gateway by [opening an issue][issues] on GitHub.\n\n### Credentials\n\nThe Gateway requires credentials to be provided on a regular basis. The only way to avoid manually having to input them every time is to store the credentials somewhere. This alone is a security risk.\n\nCurrently, IBeam expects the credentials to be available as environment variables during runtime. Whether running IBeam in a container or directly on a host machine, an unwanted user may gain access to these credentials. If your setup is exposed to a risk of someone unauthorised reading the credentials, you may want to look for other solutions than IBeam or use the Gateway standalone and authenticate manually each time.\n\nWe considered providing a possibility to read the credentials from an external credentials store, such as GCP Secrets, yet that would require some authentication credentials too, which brings back the same issue it was to solve.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nIBeam was built by traders just like you. We made it open source in order to collectively build a reliable solution. If you enjoy using IBeam, we encourage you to attempt implementing one of the following tasks:\n\n* ~~Include TLS certificates.~~\n* ~~Two Factor Authentictaion.~~\n* Remove necessity to install Java.\n* ~~Remove necessity to install Chrome or find a lighter replacement.~~\n* Add usage examples.\n* Full test coverage.\n* Improve the security issues.\n* Find a lighter replacement to using Chromium\n\nRead the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/Voyz/ibeam/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guideline to get started.\n\n----\n\n## Licence\n\nSee [LICENSE](https://github.com/Voyz/ibeam/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\n\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nIBeam is not built, maintained, or endorsed by the Interactive Brokers. \n\nUse at own discretion.
