If you'd like to see more IoT messaging providers, let me know by opening an issue!\n\nYou'll need to have your Azure IoT Hub connection string handy. You can find it under your 'Shared Access Policies' section in the IoT Hub's Azure Portal blade. Choose a policy that allows 'registry read', 'service connect' and 'device connect' at the least.\n\nYou can also list your connections strings [via the command line](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/iot/hub?view=azure-cli-latest#az-iot-hub-show-connection-string)!\n\n**Now you're ready to install the app.**\n\nWe have 2 different ways you can do this. You can do this via the [native installation](#native-installation) method below, or you can [use Docker, mentioned a bit lower](#docker-installation)!\n\n### Native Installation\n\n1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org). You can see the recommended version in the \"engines\" entry in package.json.\n\t* After installing, if you run `which node` in your [terminal](https://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything), it should print something like `/usr/local/bin/node`. If it prints nothing, there may be an issue with your Node install. First restart your terminal. If that still doesn't work, find out where on your system Node installed to, and then check your `$PATH` variable (`echo $PATH`) to see whether the Node install location is listed.\n2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.org).\n\t* As above, `which git` should print something like `/usr/local/bin/git`. If it doesn't, you can follow the same troubleshooting steps as for NodeJS.\n3. Open your terminal and run the following commands:\n\t1. `git clone https://github.com/noopkat/electric-io.git`\n\t\t* If this fails with an error message, [have a look at this page](https://help.github.com/articles/https-cloning-errors/).\n\t2. `cd electric-io`\n\t3. `npm install`\n\t\t* If this fails with an error message, [have a look at this page](https://docs.npmjs.com/troubleshooting/common-errors).\n4. Open the file `.env` in and fill in the `CONNECTION_STRING` property with your Azure IoT Hub connection string.\n5. Optional - specify the `CONSUMER_GROUP` in `.env`. _If in doubt, you can skip this step_.\n6. In your terminal again, run `npm start`.\n6. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your favourite modern browser and away you go! Try adding new cards via the settings pane on the right and click 'edit' to fill in the details!\n\n### Docker Installation Method\n\n+ Install Docker\n+ Git clone this repository\n+ Install, build, and run this project\n\n#### Docker Installation\n\nDocker is a container technology. There are native applications available for Windows and Mac. And Docker is fully supported on Linux. If you are in the latter group, this part of the guide is probably not for you. [You can get Docker for Mac, Windows, Linux right over here.](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)\n\n#### Git Cloning this Repo\n\nYou can install GIT using the instructions in the Native installation section above.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/noopkat/electric-io.git && cd electric-io\n```\n\n#### Build and run this project\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose up --build\n```\n\nYou should now see log ouput. If you `CTL-C` this will stop the container. If you would rather run this in the background, and tail the container's log output you can run the following\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose up --build -d\ndocker logs -f electric-io\n```\n\n#### Build and run project in simulating mode\n\nThe docker compose file has been configured to read from the .env file, or you can pass in your own override for whether to run in simulating mode with the following:\n\n```bash\nSIMULATING=true docker-compose up --build\n```\n\n#### Shut down the Docker Compose stack\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose down\n```\n\n## How to send the right data\n\nFor this dashboard to work, all data payloads coming in from device to Azure IoT Hub should be in json format and properties should not be nested. If you'd like to see nested properties, pull requests are welcome! üòá\n\nExample:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"humidity\": 45.68,\n  \"temperature\": 27.3\n}\n```\n\n## Types of cards and their settings\n\n### Button\n\nThis card will give you a big button to press that can map to any [device method](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-direct-methods) active on your device! Pretty cool. You can't send payloads yet, but that's coming soon!\n\nFields:\n\n1. Title - text displayed at the top of the card\n2. Device Id - the id of the device (from IoT Hub) that you want to call a method on\n3. Device Method Name - the name of the device method you want to call on your device\n4. Button text - the text you want your button to say, eg. \"turn on LED\"\n\n„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è\n\n### Line Chart\n\nThis card will plot the last 20 **numeric** values it received of the property you're watching\n\nFields:\n\n1. Title - text displayed at the top of the card\n2. Device Id - the id of the device (from IoT Hub) that you want to display telemetry for\n3. Data Property - the name of the device payload property you want to display the value of (eg. `humidity`)\n4. Line Color - the color you'd like the plotted line and points to be. Accepts `#00ff00`, `rgb(0,255,0)`, and `salmonpink` color formats üåà\n\n„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è\n\n### Number\n\nThis card will display the last value it received from a **numeric** property you're watching\n\nFields:\n\n1. Title - text displayed at the top of the card\n2. Device Id - the id of the device (from IoT Hub) that you want to display telemetry for\n3. Data Property - the name of the device payload property you want to display the value of (eg. `humidity`)\n4. Text Color - the color you'd like the number to be. Accepts `#00ff00`, `rgb(0,255,0)`, and `salmonpink` color formats üåà\n\n„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è\n\n### Sticker\n\nThis card will display a sticker on your dashboard.\n\nFields:\n\n1. Title - text displayed at the top of the card\n2. Url - a full url link to the picture you want to display on the sticker. GIFs will work! MJPEG streams are also supported. You may be able to install [mjpg-streamer](https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer) or [ffmpeg/ffserver](https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffserver.html) on your device (e.g. Raspberry Pi) to stream MJPEG via HTTP.\n\n„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è\n\n### Text\n\nThe simplest of them all! This card will display text.\n\nFields:\n\n1. Title - text displayed at the top of the card\n2. Text - text to be displayed on the card. [Markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is supported!\n\nÔ∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è\n\nGot ideas for more cards? Open an issue on this repo and let me know! üëÄ\n\n## Transferring dashboard settings\n\nelectric-io saves your dashboard configuration to `./.data/dashboard.json`. To safely transfer this elsewhere, stop the source and destination electric-io instances and copy `dashboard.json` across.\n\n```\n# With both the source and destination electric-io instances stopped\ncp ./electric-io-testing/.data/dashboard.json ./electric-io-production/.data/dashboard.json\n```\n\nThe transferred settings should show up when electric-io is started again.\n\n## Locking your dashboard\n\nA common thing you might want to do is to share your dashboard with folks without them changing things against your permission. If you'd like to temporarily 'lock' your dashboard, place the following line in your `./.env` file:\n\n```bash\nEDIT_MODE='locked'\n```\n\nThis mode will show your cards and your telemetry, but won't let them create, edit, delete, or drag cards around. The dashboard settings will also not be available.\n\nThis might also be handy for when you're happy with how everything is and want the dashboard to look a little cleaner.\n\n## Contributing\n\n**We gladly accept contributions!**\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to this repo, please read the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)!\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nTo participate, please read and follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) agreement.\n",
