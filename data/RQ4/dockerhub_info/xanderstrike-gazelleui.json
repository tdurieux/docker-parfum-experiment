  "full_description": "![](https://i.imgur.com/rRBAXAU.png)\n\nGazelleUI is a web based torrent manager a-la CouchPotato, Headphones, or SickRage, but just for [Gazelle](https://github.com/WhatCD/Gazelle) based music trackers (such as APL or PTH). It serves as a web wrapper for Gazelle's API, and downloads torrents into a folder that can be 'watched' by any torrent client for instant downloading.\n\nIt's minimal, it's fast, and it works on your phone. What more do you want.\n\n[Check out these awesome screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/fZysf)\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you've got it, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is the best way to run GazelleUI.\n\n    docker create \\\n      --name=gazelleui \\\n      --restart always \\\n      -v <path to watchfolder>:/torrents \\\n      -v <path to config>:/app/config \\\n      -e PGID=1000 -e PUID=1000  \\\n      -e TZ=America/Los_Angeles \\\n      -p 2020:2020 \\\n      xanderstrike/gazelleui\n\n* Set the watchfolder to a directory watched by your torrent client\n* PGID and PUID can be found by running `id` in a terminal\n* Timezone is your timezone\n* Configure the port by setting `2020:2020` to `<your port>:2020`\n\nRun with:\n\n    docker start gazelleui\n\n### Without Docker or for Development\n\nGazelleUI is designed with seedboxes in mind. These instructions are for Ubuntu, but it'll run on most any linux or osx box.\n\nDownload or clone this repository.\n\nSet up the prerequisites and run:\n\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get install wget python3-pip\n    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt\n    python GazelleUI.py\n\n\nThen visit `<ip-address>:2020` to set it up!\n\n### License\n\nMIT license\n\nLogo credit Focus Lab via NounProject: https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=gazelle&i=549876\n",
