It lets you use Go interactively in a browser-based notebook or desktop app.  Use `gophernotes` to create and share documents that contain live Go code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.  These notebooks, with the live Go code, can then be shared with others via email, Dropbox, GitHub and the [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Go forth and do data science, or anything else interesting, with Go notebooks!\n\n**Acknowledgements** - This project utilizes a Go interpreter called [gomacro](https://github.com/cosmos72/gomacro) under the hood to evaluate Go code interactively. The gophernotes logo was designed by the brilliant [Marcus Olsson](https://github.com/marcusolsson) and was inspired by Renee French's original Go Gopher design.\n\n- [Examples](#examples)\n- Install gophernotes:\n  - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n  - [Linux](#linux)\n  - [Mac](#mac)\n  - [Windows](#windows)\n  - [Docker](#docker)\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n- [Limitations](#limitations)\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n\n## Examples\n\n### Jupyter Notebook:\n\n![](files/jupyter.gif)\n\n### nteract:\n\n![](files/nteract.gif)\n\n### Example Notebooks (dowload and run them locally, follow the links to view in Github, or use the [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)):\n- [Worker Pools](examples/Worker_Pools.ipynb)\n- [Matrix Operations](examples/Matrix_Operations.ipynb)\n- [Facial Recognition](examples/Facial_Recognition_MachineBox.ipynb)\n- [Display Images, HTML, LaTeX...](examples/Display.ipynb)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [Go 1.9+](https://golang.org/doc/install) - including GOPATH/bin added to your PATH (i.e., you can run Go binaries that you `go install`).\n- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) or [nteract](https://nteract.io/desktop)\n- [ZeroMQ 4.X.X](http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software) - for convenience, pre-built Windows binaries (v4.2.1) are included in the zmq-win directory.\n- [pkg-config](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pkg-config)\n\n### Linux\n\n```sh\n$ go get -u github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes\n$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/gophernotes\n$ cp $GOPATH/src/github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes/kernel/* ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/gophernotes\n```\n\nTo confirm that the `gophernotes` binary is installed and in your PATH, you should see the following when running `gophernotes` directly:\n\n```sh\n$ gophernotes\n2017/09/20 10:33:12 Need a command line argument specifying the connection file.\n```\n\n**Note** - if you have the `JUPYTER_PATH` environmental variable set or if you are using an older version of Jupyter, you may need to copy this kernel config to another directory.  You can check which directories will be searched by executing:\n\n```sh\n$ jupyter --data-dir\n```\n\n### Mac\n\n**Important Note** - gomacro relies on the `plugin` package when importing third party libraries. This package works reliably on Mac OS X only with Go 1.10.2+ as long as you **never** execute the command `strip gophernotes`.\nIf you can only compile gophernotes with Go <= 1.10.1 on Mac, consider using the [Docker](#docker) install and run gophernotes/Jupyter in Docker.\n\n```sh\n$ go get -u github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes\n$ mkdir -p ~/Library/Jupyter/kernels/gophernotes\n$ cp $GOPATH/src/github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes/kernel/* ~/Library/Jupyter/kernels/gophernotes\n```\n\nTo confirm that the `gophernotes` binary is installed and in your PATH, you should see the following when running `gophernotes` directly:\n\n```sh\n$ gophernotes\n2017/09/20 10:33:12 Need a command line argument specifying the connection file.\n```\n\n**Note** - if you have the `JUPYTER_PATH` environmental variable set or if you are using an older version of Jupyter, you may need to copy this kernel config to another directory.  You can check which directories will be searched by executing:\n\n```sh\n$ jupyter --data-dir\n```\n\n### Windows\n\n**Important Note** - gomacro relies on the `plugin` package when importing third party libraries.  This package is only supported on Linux and Mac OS X currently.  Thus, if you need to utilize third party packages in your Go notebooks and you are running on Windows, you should use the [Docker](#docker) install and run gophernotes/Jupyter in Docker.\n\nMake sure you have the MinGW toolchain:\n\n- [MinGW-w64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/), for 32 and 64 bit Windows\n- [MinGW Distro](https://nuwen.net/mingw.html), for 64 bit Windows only\n\nThen:\n\n1. build and install gophernotes (using the pre-built binaries and `zmq-win\\build.bat`):\n\n    ```\n    REM Download w/o building.\n    go get -d -u github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes\n    cd %GOPATH%\\src\\github.com\\gopherdata\\gophernotes\\zmq-win\n\n    REM Build x64 version.\n    build.bat amd64\n    move gophernotes.exe %GOPATH%\\bin\n    copy lib-amd64\\libzmq.dll %GOPATH%\\bin\n\n    REM Build x86 version.\n    build.bat 386\n    move gophernotes.exe %GOPATH%\\bin\n    copy lib-386\\libzmq.dll %GOPATH%\\bin\n    ```\n\n3. Copy the kernel config:\n\n    ```\n    mkdir %APPDATA%\\jupyter\\kernels\\gophernotes\n    xcopy %GOPATH%\\src\\github.com\\gopherdata\\gophernotes\\kernel %APPDATA%\\jupyter\\kernels\\gophernotes /s\n    ```\n\n    Note, if you have the `JUPYTER_PATH` environmental variable set or if you are using an older version of Jupyter, you may need to copy this kernel config to another directory.  You can check which directories will be searched by executing:\n\n    ```\n    jupyter --data-dir\n    ```\n\n4. Update `%APPDATA%\\jupyter\\kernels\\gophernotes\\kernel.json` with the FULL PATH to your gophernotes.exe (in %GOPATH%\\bin), unless it's already on the PATH.  For example:\n\n    ```\n    {\n        \"argv\": [\n          \"C:\\\\gopath\\\\bin\\\\gophernotes.exe\",\n          \"{connection_file}\"\n          ],\n        \"display_name\": \"Go\",\n        \"language\": \"go\",\n        \"name\": \"go\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n### Docker\n\nYou can try out or run Jupyter + gophernotes without installing anything using Docker. To run a Go notebook that only needs things from the standard library, run:\n\n```\n$ docker run -it -p 8888:8888 gopherdata/gophernotes\n```\n\nOr to run a Go notebook with access to common Go data science packages (gonum, gota, golearn, etc.), run:\n\n```\n$ docker run -it -p 8888:8888 gopherdata/gophernotes:latest-ds\n```\n\nIn either case, running this command should output a link that you can follow to access Jupyter in a browser. Also, to save notebooks to and/or load notebooks from a location outside of the Docker image, you should utilize a volume mount.  For example:\n\n```\n$ docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v /path/to/local/notebooks:/path/to/notebooks/in/docker gopherdata/gophernotes\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Jupyter\n\n- If you completed one of the local installs above (i.e., not the Docker install), start the jupyter notebook server:\n\n  ```\n  jupyter notebook\n  ```\n\n- Select `Go` from the `New` drop down menu.\n\n- Have fun!\n\n### nteract\n\n- Launch nteract.\n\n- From the nteract menu select Language -> Go.\n\n- Have fun!\n\n## Limitations\n\ngophernotes uses [gomacro](https://github.com/cosmos72/gomacro) under the hood to evaluate Go code interactively. You can evaluate most any Go code with gomacro, but there are some limitations, which are discussed in further detail [here](https://github.com/cosmos72/gomacro#current-status).  Most notably, gophernotes does NOT support:\n\n- third party packages when running natively on Windows - This is a current limitation of the Go `plugin` package.\n- some corner cases on interpreted interfaces, as interface -&gt; interface type switch and type assertion, are not implemented yet.\n- conversion from typed constant to interpreted interface is not implemented. Workaround: assign the constant to a variable, then convert the variable to the interpreted interface type.\n- goto is only partially implemented.\n- out-of-order code in the same cell is supported, but not heavily tested. It has some known limitations for composite literals.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### gophernotes not found\n\nDepending on your environment, you may need to manually change the path to the `gophernotes` executable in `kernel/kernel.json` before copying it to `~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/gophernotes`.  You can put the **full path** to the `gophernotes` executable here, and you shouldn't have any further issues.\n\n### \"Kernel error\" in a running notebook\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/notebook/base/handlers.py\", line 458, in wrapper\n    result = yield gen.maybe_future(method(self, *args, **kwargs))\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tornado/gen.py\", line 1008, in run\n    value = future.result()\n  ...\n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.11/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/subprocess.py\", line 1335, in _execute_child\n    raise child_exception\nOSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory\n```\n\nStop jupyter, if it's already running.\n\nAdd a symlink to `/go/bin/gophernotes` from your path to the gophernotes executable.
