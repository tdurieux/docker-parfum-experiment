  "full_description": "AlloyCI is a Continuous Integration, Deployment, and Delivery coordinator, written in Elixir.\n\nIt takes advantage of the GitLab CI Runner, and its capabilities as executor.\n\nAlloyCI aims to bridge the gap between GitLab's CI runner and GitHub. GitLab's CI runner is tightly coupled with GitLab, so it is not possible to use one of these runners from a GitHub codebase.\n\nWith AlloyCI you will be able to register a GitLab CI runner to the platform, connect it to one of your GitHub repositories, and have it run your CI and CD pipelines.\n\nAlloyCI will report the status of your pipelines to your pull requests and branches, so you can always know their status, just like any other CI service.\n\nFor installation instructions, please see our documentation at https://github.com/AlloyCI/alloy_ci/tree/master/doc#installation",
