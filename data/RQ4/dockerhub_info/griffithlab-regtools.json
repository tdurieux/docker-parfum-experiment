Then run `mkdocs serve` from within the `regtools`\nbase directory.\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nRegtools uses several open-source libraries. We would like to thank the\ndevelopers of htslib and bedtools. We would also like to thank Travis Abbott for\nuseful comments and code.\n\n## License\n\nThe project is licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n## Stable release with DOI\n\n[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/35841695.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/35841695)\n\n\n",
