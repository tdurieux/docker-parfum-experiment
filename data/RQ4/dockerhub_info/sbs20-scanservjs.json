Furthermore, scans just being accessible via\n> an awesome web interface makes it even more brilliant!\n\n\n> This is a great project! The touchscreen and buttons on my Brother scanner are\n> broken, meaning the device is useless by itself because one cannot trigger\n> scans, but with this project I can trigger it remotely just fine.\n\n## About\n\nscanservjs is a web UI frontend for your scanner. It allows you to share one or\nmore scanners (using SANE) on a network without the need for drivers or\ncomplicated installation.\n\n## Features\n\n* Cropping\n* Source selection (Flatbed / ADF)\n* Resolution\n* Output formats (TIF, JPG, PNG, PDF and TXT with Tesseract OCR) with varying\n  compression settings\n* Filters: Autolevels, Threshold, Blur\n* Configurable overrides for all defaults as well as filters and formats\n* Multipage scanning (with collation for double sided scans)\n* International translations: Czech, French, German, Italian, Mandarin, Polish,\n  Portuguese (BR), Russian, Spanish;\n  [Help requested](https://github.com/sbs20/scanservjs/issues/154)\n* Light and dark mode\n* Responsive design\n\nIt supports any\n[SANE compatible devices](http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html).\n\n## Requirements\n\n* SANE Scanner\n* Linux host (or VM with necessary pass-through e.g. USB)\n* Software sane-utils, ImageMagick, Tesseract (optional) and nodejs\n\n## Installation\n\n* [Manual installation](docs/install.md)\n* [Docker installation](docs/docker.md)\n* [Scanner and SANE setup](docs/sane.md)\n* [Proxy setup](docs/proxy.md)\n* [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md)\n* [Development notes](docs/development.md)\n\n## Configuration and device override\n\nIf you want to override some specific configuration settings then you can do so\nwithin `./config/config.local.js`. See [Configuration](docs/config.md) for more\ndetail.\n\n## Why?\n\nThis is yet another scanimage-web-front-end. Why? It originally started as an\nadaptation of phpsane - just to make everything a bit newer, give it a refresh\nand make it work on minimal installations without imagemagick - that version is\n[still available](https://github.com/sbs20/scanserv) but is no longer\nmaintained. Since then, I just wanted to write it in node and enhance it a bit,\nand it's been a labour of love ever since.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n * This project owes its genesis to\n   [phpsane](http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpsane/)\n * [Everyone](https://github.com/sbs20/scanservjs/graphs/contributors) who has\n   filed issues, tested, fixed issues, added translations and helped over the\n   years. Thank you!\n\n## More about SANE\n\n * http://www.sane-project.org/\n",
