  "full_description": "# KoBoCAT\n\n## Important notice when upgrading from any release older than [`2.020.18`](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobocat/releases/tag/2.020.18)\n\nUp to and including release [`2.020.18`](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobocat/releases/tag/2.020.18), this project (KoBoCAT) and [KPI](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi) both shared a common Postgres database. They now each have their own. **If you are upgrading an existing single-database installation, you must follow [these instructions](https://community.kobotoolbox.org/t/upgrading-to-separate-databases-for-kpi-and-kobocat/7202)** to migrate the KPI tables to a new database and adjust your configuration appropriately.\n\nIf you do not want to upgrade at this time, please use the [`shared-database-obsolete`](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobocat/tree/shared-database-obsolete) branch instead.\n\n## Deprecation Notices\n\nMuch of the user-facing features of this application are being migrated\nto <https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi>. KoBoCAT's data-access API and\nOpenRosa functions will remain intact, and any plans to the contrary\nwill be announced well in advance. For more details and discussion,\nplease refer to\n<https://community.kobotoolbox.org/t/contemplating-the-future-of-kobocat/2743>.\n\nAs features are migrated, we will list them here along with the last\nrelease where each was present:\n\n  - To ensure security and stability, many endpoints that were already\n    available in KPI, long-unsupported, or underutilized have been removed in\n    release\n    [2.020.40](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobocat/releases/tag/2.020.40).\n    These were related to charts and stats, form cloning, form sharing, user\n    profiles, organizations / projects / teams, bamboo, and ziggy. For a full\n    list, please see [REMOVALS.md](REMOVALS.md). These endpoints were last\n    available in the release\n    [2.020.39](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobocat/releases/tag/2.020.39).\n  - REST Services - an improved version [has been added to\n    KPI](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/1864). The last KoBoCAT\n    release to contain legacy REST services is\n    [2.019.39](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobocat/releases/tag/2.019.39).\n\n## About\n\nkobocat is the data collection platform used in KoBoToolbox. It is based\non the excellent [onadata](http://github.com/onaio/onadata) platform\ndeveloped by Ona LLC, which in itself is a redevelopment of the\n[formhub](http://github.com/SEL-Columbia/formhub) platform developed by\nthe Sustainable Engineering Lab at Columbia University.\n\nPlease refer to\n[kobo-install](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobo-install) for\ninstructions on how to install KoBoToolbox.\n\n## Code Structure\n\n  - **logger** - This app serves XForms to and receives submissions from\n    ODK Collect and Enketo.\n  - **viewer** - This app provides a csv and xls export of the data\n    stored in logger. This app uses a data dictionary as produced by\n    pyxform. It also provides a map and single survey view.\n  - **main** - This app is the glue that brings logger and viewer\n    together.\n\n## Localization\n\nTo generate a locale from scratch (ex. Spanish)\n\n``` sh\n$ django-admin.py makemessages -l es -e py,html,email,txt ;\n$ for app in {main,viewer} ; do cd kobocat/apps/${app} && django-admin.py makemessages -d djangojs -l es && cd - ; done\n```\n\nTo update PO files\n\n``` sh\n$ django-admin.py makemessages -a ;\n$ for app in {main,viewer} ; do cd kobocat/apps/${app} && django-admin.py makemessages -d djangojs -a && cd - ; done\n```\n\nTo compile MO files and update live translations\n\n``` sh\n$ django-admin.py compilemessages ;\n$ for app in {main,viewer} ; do cd kobocat/apps/${app} && django-admin.py compilemessages && cd - ; done\n```\n## Testing in KoBoCAT\n\nFor kobo-install users, enter the folder for kobo-install and run this command\n\n```\n./run.py -cf exec kobocat bash\n```\n\nFor all other users, enter the container using this command\n\n``` sh\n$ docker exec -it {{kobocat container}} /bin/bash\n```\n\nRun pip install the development dependencies\n\n``` sh\n$ pip install -r requirements/dev.pip\n```\n\nRun pytest to run all automated tests\n\n``` sh\n$ pytest\n```\n",
