The sensor will complete the handshake (in case of tcp), and store the payload\n* Create high interaction honeypots using the LXC or remote hosts directors, traffic will be man-in-the-middle proxied, while information will be extracted\n* Extend honeytrap with existing honeypots (like cowrie or glutton), while using the logging and listening framework of Honeytrap\n* Advanced logging system with filtering and logging to Elasticsearch, Kafka, Splunk, Raven, File or Console\n* Services are easily extensible and will extract as much information as possible\n* Low- to high interaction Honeypots, where connections will be upgraded seamless to high interaction\n\n## To start using Honeytrap\n\nSee our documentation on [docs.honeytrap.io](http://docs.honeytrap.io/).\n\n## Community\nJoin the [honeytrap-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/honeytrap-users) mailing list to discuss all things Honeytrap.\n\n## Creators\n\n[DutchSec](https://dutchsec.com)â€™s mission is to safeguard the evolution of technology and therewith humanity.
