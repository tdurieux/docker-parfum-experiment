  "full_description": "# Duplo (C/C++/Java Duplicate Source Code Block Finder)\n\nThis project is found in GitHub: [https://github.com/dlidstrom/Duplo](https://github.com/dlidstrom/Duplo).\n\n## General Information\n\nDuplicated source code blocks can harm maintainability of software systems.\nDuplo is a tool to find duplicated code blocks in large C, C++, Java, C# and\nVB.Net systems.\n\n## Maintainer\n\nDuplo was originally developed by Christian\nM. Ammann and is now maintained and developed by Daniel\nLidstrÃ¶m.\n\n## Usage\n\nDuplo works with a list of files. You can either specify a file that contains the list of files, or you can pass them using `stdin`.\n\nRun `duplo --help` on the command line to see the detailed options.\n\n### Passing files using `stdin`\n\n```bash\n# Docker on unix\n> find . -type f \\( -iname \"*.cpp\" -or -iname \"*.h\" \\) | docker run --rm -i -w /src -v $(pwd):/src dlidstrom/duplo - out.txt\n```\n\n`duplo` will write the duplicated blocks into `out.txt`.\n\n### Passing files using file\n\n`duplo` can analyze files specified in a separate file:\n\n```bash\n# Docker on unix\n> find . -type f \\( -iname \"*.cpp\" -o -iname \"*.h\" \\) > files.lst\n> docker run --rm -i -w /src -v $(pwd):/src dlidstrom/duplo files.lst out.txt\n```\n\nAgain, `duplo` will write the duplicated blocks into `out.txt`.\n\n## Feedback and Bug Reporting\n\nPlease open a GitHub issue to discuss feedback,\nfeature requests and bug reports.\n\n## License\n\nDuplo is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nDuplo is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
