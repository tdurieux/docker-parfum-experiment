  "full_description": "# AzuraRelay\nA \"relay in a box\" containing a lightweight web application and Icecast servers that can connect to and relay an AzuraRelay parent instance.\n\n## Parent Installation Requirements\n\nBefore installing AzuraRelay, make sure your \"parent\" AzuraCast installation:\n\n- is updated to the latest version,\n- has the direct radio ports (i.e. 8000, 8010) exposed (i.e. isn't behind a CloudFlare proxy)\n\n## Installing\n\nAzuraRelay is powered by Docker and uses pre-built images that contain every component of the software. Don't worry if you aren't very familiar with Docker; our easy installer tools will handle installing Docker and Docker Compose for you, and updates are very simple.\n\n### System Requirements\n\n- A 64-bit x86 (x86_64) CPU (ARM devices, like the Raspberry Pi 3/4, are not supported.)\n- 512MB or greater of RAM\n- 20GB or greater of hard drive space\n\nFor Linux hosts, the `sudo`, `curl` and `git` packages should be installed before installing . Most Linux distributions include these packages already.\n\n### Installing\n\nConnect to the server or computer you want to install AzuraRelay on via an SSH terminal. You should be an administrator user with either root access or the ability to use the `sudo` command.\n\nPick a base directory on your host computer that AzuraRelay can use. If you're on Linux, you can follow the steps below to use the recommended directory:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /var/azurarelay\ncd /var/azurarelay\n```\n\nUse these commands to download our Docker Utility Script, set it as executable and then run the Docker installation process:\n\n```bash\ncurl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AzuraCast/AzuraRelay/master/docker.sh > docker.sh\nchmod a+x docker.sh\n./docker.sh install\n```\n\nOn-screen prompts will show you how the installation is progressing.\n\n### Updating\n\nUsing the included Docker utility script, updating is as simple as running:\n\n```bash\n./docker.sh update-self\n./docker.sh update\n```",
