They can also be as many sub levels as you want, like #sub-hash-tag\n\n**note**\nThis version is a completey different version than the old (https://github.com/xeor/taggo/tree/0.2).\nThe old version works for python 2 (but not 3). It also had config-file instead of parameters. Check out the\nrepo if you want it..\n\n* Free software: MIT license\n* Documentation: https://taggo.readthedocs.io\n* Source: https://github.com/xeor/taggo\n* Issues: https://github.com/xeor/taggo/issues\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nThis project is in beta stage, please report bugs :)\n\nAny questions, thoughts, bugs are very welcome!\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n* 3.6+\n\n\nDocker\n------\n\nStart the container with environment variables like `CRON_TAGGO_0` with the format `* * * * *|run ....`\n\n* CRON_TAGGO_n where n is a number, start at 0, have as many as you want.\n* We take care automaticly that only 1 of each number is running at a time. Example, if one of your job is running every minute and it takes more than a minute to finish. It wont start the 2nd time.\n* The environment variable is split in 2 by a `|`. The first param is a cron, the 2nd is the parameters sent to the `taggo` command.\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n* Why the name taggo?\n\n  * It's a tagging tool. It does stuff with tags. What do you suggest? Tagging, taggs, tags, tag2fold... no.. Taggo!\n\n* Why do you want to create tags with symlinks?\n\n  * Because everyone have underestimated the power of tagging data.\n  * Photo filenames are just wasted, what does DCIM1234.jpg tell you?\n  * You know you miss one folder that contains all your dog pictures.\n  * You sould not depend on a 3rd party program/database to manage\n    your files/photos.\n",
