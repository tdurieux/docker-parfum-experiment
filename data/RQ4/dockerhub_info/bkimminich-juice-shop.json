Create a resource group by running `az group create --name <group\n   name> --location <location name, e.g. \"centralus\">`\n3. Create a new container by running `az container create\n   --resource-group <group name> --name <container name> --image\n   bkimminich/juice-shop --dns-name-label <dns name label> --ports 3000\n   --ip-address public`\n4.

Login to the Google Cloud Console and\n   [open Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?cloudshell=true).\n2. Launch a new GCE instance based on the juice-shop container. Take\n   note of the `EXTERNAL_IP` provided in the output.\n\n```\ngcloud compute instances create-with-container owasp-juice-shop-app --container-image bkimminich/juice-shop\n```\n\n3. Create a firewall rule that allows inbound traffic to port 3000\n\n```\ngcloud compute firewall-rules create juice-rule --allow tcp:3000\n```\n\n4. Your container is now running and available at\n   `http://<EXTERNAL_IP>:3000/`\n\n## Demo\n\nFeel free to have a look at the latest version of OWASP Juice Shop:\n<http://demo.owasp-juice.shop>\n\n> This is a deployment-test and sneak-peek instance only!
