Check [here](https://github.com/petersem/posterr/wiki/Latest-changes) for detailed notes on each updated.\n\n## Features\n - Displays movies, shows, music poster for what is currently playing.\n - Displays random (on-demand) titles from multiple Plex libraries.\n - Displays custom pictures, background art, and themes\n - Shows coming soon titles from Sonarr (or Season premieres).\n - Shows coming soon titles from Radarr.\n - Shows coming soon books from Readarr.\n - Optionally plays TV and Movies themes, if available\n - A playing progress bar (green for direct play and red for transcoding)\n - Various metadata displayed, such as run time, content rating, studio, etc. \n - Move the mouse cursor to the bottom footer of the page to hide it\n - Background artwork option for improved landscape view (when available)\n - Automatically scales for most display sizes and orientation.\n - Sleep timer \n - Trivia Quiz (multiple selectable topics)\n\n## Installation\nInstallation details are as follows:\n### Docker Compose (X86, ARM32, ARM64)\nCreate the following directories in your docker folder:\n - ./docker/posterr/config\n - ./docker/posterr/custom\n\n```ya\nversion: '2.4'\n\nservices:\n  posterr:\n    image: petersem/posterr\n    container_name: posterr\n    environment:\n      TZ: Australia/Brisbane\n      BASEPATH: \"\"\n    volumes:\n      - ./docker/posterr/config:/usr/src/app/config\n      - ./docker/posterr/custom:/usr/src/app/public/custom\n    ports:\n      - 9876:3000\n    restart: unless-stopped\n```\n#### Details\n|Option|Details|\n|--|--|\n|TZ|Your local timezone. Go to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) and use the `TZ Database Name` value.|\n|/docker/posterr/config|This is required to save your Posterr settings|\n|/docker/posterr/custom|This is required for custom pictures (and other custom media in the future)|\n|Ports|Change first part to a different port if needed. e.g. 9876:3000|\n|BASEPATH|_\"/path\"_ Use this for reverse proxy setups which require a base path value. **This line can be left out, or value left blank** if you dont use alternate paths. |\n\n### Unraid\n - Use the Posterr template in community apps.\n - I do not maintain or control the Posterr template in the community apps. If there is something missing or incorrect in this template, please contact the template author, so they can update it. \n\n### Binaries (Windows, Linux, MacOS)\n- Get the latest binary release package from [here](https://github.com/petersem/posterr/releases)\n- Create a directory called `posterr` anywhere on your machine\n- Extract the appropriate binary for your machine and place it in this folder.\n- Run the executable file (double click or type posterr-windows.exe from windows, or ./posterr-xxx from Linux/MacOS)\n- Read the text file in the zip for parameter options\n  \n|Parameter|Details|\n|--|--|\n|Port number|Add a port number after the executable name like: 'poster-win 6969' (no parameter defaults to 3000)|\n|Base path|Use this for reverse proxies that require a base path value. If you need this, you must also enter a port number. (e.g. 'posterr-win 3000 /posterr')|\n\n > Posterr also works well on Windows as a service, using [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/)\n \n > Not yet tested on Linux or MacOS running as a service, however I expect it should work.\n\n\n## Updates\n - From v1.10.1, there will be a notice at the top of the settings screen informing you if you are running an old version. \n - Use containrr/watchtower to auto-update Posterr in Docker environments\n - Update in the usual way for Unraid\n - Direct binaries should just be overwritten with the new version. \n \n## Setup\nGet to the settings page in a number of ways:\n - On initial load, you will be prompted.\n - Change the URL to _'http://hostIP:9876/settings'_ (where `hostIP` is the IP number of the machine that Posterr is installed on. Change the port number if you set a different value. 3000 is the default for the binary executables)\n - Clicking on the top banner title of any slide.\n - If on the 'no content' page, then click this text\n\n*The default password is:* **raidisnotabackup**\n\n## Possible Uses\n - Mount a monitor on your wall and showcase your home media setup\n - Use it on a second monitor to keep an eye on what is running\n - Run it on a small screen mounted outside your theater room to show when a movie is in progress\n - Use a reverse proxy, or port-forward, to let your friends see what is playing, available, and coming soon\n\n## Technical Features\n - Built in Node JS, and packaged as a Docker image. (included image health check)\n - Direct binary files also provided for MacOS, Linux, and Windows.\n - Low resource usage. Memory: 20-35mb, Diskspace: ~75mb, CPU: < 1% (running on a Synology NAS with a Celeron processor)\n - Checks for updates in Now Screening / Playing every 10 seconds (Will not display updates until browser refreshed or all slides cycled through)\n - Browser-based, so can run the app on one machine and a browser on another.\n - Browser connectivity checks and auto-reconnect when the Posterr app restarts. (eg During container updates) \n - Supports screen resolution heights from 320 pixels to around 3500 pixels. \n - Supports reverse proxy setup for wildcard dns or alternate base path.\n - Built-in recovery features should the Poster app, or Plex, go offline.\n\n > Please see the [Posterr Wiki](https://github.com/petersem/posterr/wiki/Posterr-Configuration) for more information.\n\n## Troubleshooting\nShould you encounter a problem, the solution may be listed [HERE](https://github.com/petersem/posterr/wiki/Troubleshooting).\n\n## Support\n - There is no _'official'_ support for this product, however should you encounter issues, raise an issue on the github page.\n - Limited support in [Discord](https://discord.gg/pucjF6j8k9)\n\n### Support my efforts and continued development \n\n> [![](https://github.com/petersem/posterr/blob/master/doco/coffeesmall.gif?raw=true)](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/thanksmp)\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMatt Petersen (April 2021)\n\n## Technical Details\nPosterr uses the following:\n - Node & Node Express\n - The awesome [Node-Plex-APi](https://github.com/phillipj/node-plex-api)\n - Jquery\n - Bootstrap\n - Font-Awesome\n - Plex (via PlexAPI)\n - Sonarr (via API)\n - Radarr (via API)\n - Readarr (via API)\n - Posters and artwork from Plex, TVDB and TMDB.\n\n## Notice\n> Posterr is dependant on third party applications and services.
