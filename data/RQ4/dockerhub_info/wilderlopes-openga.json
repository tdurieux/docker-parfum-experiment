  "full_description": "For details, please visit https://www.openga.org\n\nOpen-source Geometric Algebra (OpenGA) is a hub for tools and algorithms devised in light of Geometric Algebra (GA) (also known as Clifford Algebra). GA encompasses many of the standard algebraic systems used for describing geometric transformations, e.g., linear/matrix algebra, complex algebra, quaternions etc. GA-based algorithms benefit from the intrinsic mathematical generality of GA. In the core of OpenGA algorithms reside open-source libraries/toolboxes like GABLE (Geometric AlgeBra Learning Environment) and GAALET (Geometric Algebra ALgorithms Expression Templates) by Florian Seybold (https://sourceforge.net/projects/gaalet/). OpenGA is for researchers, engineers, and developers willing to apply GA in their projects.\n\n",
