  "full_description": "**Sonic is a fast, lightweight and schema-less search backend. It ingests search texts and identifier tuples that can then be queried against in a microsecond's time.**\n\nSonic can be used as a simple alternative to super-heavy and full-featured search backends such as Elasticsearch in some use-cases. It is capable of normalizing natural language search queries, auto-completing a search query and providing the most relevant results for a query. Sonic is an identifier index, rather than a document index; when queried, it returns IDs that can then be used to refer to the matched documents in an external database.\n\nA strong attention to performance and code cleanliness has been given when designing Sonic. It aims at being crash-free, super-fast and puts minimum strain on server resources (our measurements have shown that Sonic - when under load - responds to search queries in the Î¼s range, eats ~30MB RAM and has a low CPU footprint; [see our benchmarks](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic#how-fast--lightweight-is-it)).\n\n**ðŸ“š The full README is available on GitHub: [valeriansaliou/sonic](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic).**",
