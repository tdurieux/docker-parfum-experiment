I read it when I wake up so that I can feel anxious without having to get my phone.\n\n## survey\n\n**[New!]** In response to feedback, I'm collecting anonymous survey responses. Do you want a goosepaper delivered but without requiring any code? Please [let me know your thoughts!](https://forms.gle/t3PUp2TxDQnzzs8x9)\n\n## get started with docker\n\nBy far the easiest way to get started with Goosepaper is to use Docker.\n\n### step 0: write your config file\n\nWrite a config file to tell Goosepaper what news you want to read. An example is provided in `example-config.json`.\n\n### step 1: generate your paper\n\nFrom the directory that has the config file in it, run the following:\n\n```shell\ndocker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/goosepaper/mount j6k4m8/goosepaper goosepaper -c mount/example-config.json -o mount/Goosepaper.pdf\n```\n\n(where `example-config.json` is the name of the config file to use).\n\n### step 2: you are done!\n\nIf you want to both generate the PDF as well as upload it to your reMarkable tablet, you can pass the `--upload` flag to the docker command above. You must additionally mount your `~/.rmapy` file:\n\n```shell\ndocker run -it --rm \\\n    -v $(pwd):/goosepaper/mount \\\n    -v $HOME/.rmapy:/root/.rmapy \\\n    j6k4m8/goosepaper \\\n    goosepaper -c mount/example-config.json -o mount/Goosepaper.pdf --upload\n```\n\nOtherwise, you can now email this PDF to your tablet, perhaps using [ReMailable](https://github.com/j6k4m8/remailable).\n\n## get started without docker: installation\n\n### dependencies:\n\nthis tool uses `weasyprint` to generate PDFs. You can install all of the python libraries you need with `pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt` from this repo, but you may need these prerequisites before getting started.\n\nmore details [here](https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).\n\n#### mac:\n\n```shell\nbrew install cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libffi\n```\n\n#### ubuntu-flavored:\n\n```shell\nsudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-wheel python3-cffi libcairo2 libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libffi-dev shared-mime-info\n```\n\n#### windows:\n\n[Follow these instructions carefully](https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#windows).\n\n## and then:\n\nFrom inside the goosepaper repo,\n\n```shell\npip3 install -e .\n```\n\n## get started\n\nYou can customize your goosepaper by editing `config.json`. (More instructions, and customization tools, all coming soon!)\n\n```shell\ngoosepaper --config myconfig.json --output mypaper.pdf\n```\n\nIf you don't pass an output flag, one will be generated based upon the time of generation. You DO need to pass a config file for now.\n\nAn example config file is included here: [example-config.json](example-config.json).\n\n---\n\nCheck out [this example PDF](https://github.com/j6k4m8/goosepaper/blob/master/docs/Example-Nov-1-2020.pdf), generated on Nov 1 2020.\n\n## existing story providers ([want to write your own?](https://github.com/j6k4m8/goosepaper/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md))\n\n-   [Wikipedia Top News / Current Events](https://github.com/j6k4m8/goosepaper/blob/master/goosepaper/wikipedia.py)\n-   [Tweets](https://github.com/j6k4m8/goosepaper/blob/master/goosepaper/twitter.py)\n-   [Weather](https://github.com/j6k4m8/goosepaper/blob/master/goosepaper/weather.py).

You may generate a print-ready PDF which you can use on another kind of robot as well! Just remove the last line of `main.py`.\n\n### very nice! may i have it in comic sans?\n\nyes! you may do anything that you find to be fun and welcoming :)\n\nCheck out the `styles.Styles` enum in the goosepaper library. You will find there what you seek.\n\n### do all dogs' names start with the letter \"B\"?\n\nI do not think so, but it is a good question!\n\n### may i use this to browse twitter?\n\nyes you may! you can add a list of usernames to the feed generator and it will make a print-ready version of twitter. this is helpful for when you are on twitter on your laptop but wish you had Other Twitter as well, in print form.\n\n# You May Also Like...\n\n-   [remailable](https://github.com/j6k4m8/remailable): Email PDF documents to your reMarkable tablet\n-   [rmapy fork](https://github.com/j6k4m8/rmapy): My fork of rmapy, with added features and bugfixes\n",
