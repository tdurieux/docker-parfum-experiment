It also helps full nodes to split\n# the network between two forks and avoid cross network noise.\n#\n# Consecutive blocks are needed to prevent any malicious miner from minting a\n# non-forked block with the fork extradata. Unless almost all non-forking miners\n# are malicious, there will be a non-forking block in the first 10 that does not\n# have the fork extra-data set, separating that chain from the forked chain.\nFROM alpine:latest\n\n# Install curl to allow controlling the simulator as well as to interact with the\n# client via HTTP-RPC, bash and jq to allow writing a bit more exotic test scripts.\nRUN apk add --no-cache --update bash curl jq\n\n# Configure the initial setup for the individual nodes\nADD genesis.json /genesis.json\nENV HIVE_FORK_DAO_BLOCK 3\n\n# Add the simulation controller\nADD simulator.sh /simulator.sh\nRUN chmod +x /simulator.sh\n\nENTRYPOINT [\"/simulator.sh\"]\n"
