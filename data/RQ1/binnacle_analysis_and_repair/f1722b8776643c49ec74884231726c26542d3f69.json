It uses two stages. In the first stage, it builds/compiles\n# Chuffed in the same OS as the MiniZinc Challenge docker image. The second\n# stage extends the provided MiniZinc Challenge docker image by copying the\n# Chuffed executable and its MiniZinc library across from the first stage as\n# well as installing missing libraries for running Chuffed if necessary.\n# Note that you do not have to use multi stages. Everything can be done in a\n# one stage build. However, Note that the statements ADD, RUN, and COPY can\n# add image layers, which can increase the size of the layer you have to\n# upload.\n#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#\n# 1.
