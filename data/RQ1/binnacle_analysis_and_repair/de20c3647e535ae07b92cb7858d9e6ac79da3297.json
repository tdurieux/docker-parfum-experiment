The version\n# of that release is specified in the VERSION arg in this file, and is automatically updated as described below.\n#\n# Several processes occur using this file which are kicked off by our Expeditor pipeline tooling:\n#\n# When a build makes it through our internal CI system and is promoted to our \"unstable\" channel Expeditor will\n# trigger a Docker image build of that version and push it to Docker Hub.\n#\n# When tests of an unstable build pass within our CI system it will be promoted to the \"current\" channel and\n# Expeditor will tag that image as \"current\" on Docker Hub.\n#\n# When a build is promoted to our \"stable\" channel .expeditor/update_dockerfile.sh is run to update the version\n# in this file and also tag that image as \"latest\" on Docker Hub. Additionally major and minor tags will be\n# applied so 15.0.260 would be tagged as \"latest\", \"15\" and \"15.0\", as well as \"15.0.260\".\n\nFROM busybox\nMAINTAINER Chef Software, Inc. <docker@chef.io>\n\nARG CHANNEL=stable\nARG VERSION=15.0.300\n\nRUN wget \"https://packages.chef.io/files/${CHANNEL}/chef/${VERSION}/el/6/chef-${VERSION}-1.el6.x86_64.rpm\" -O /tmp/chef-client.rpm && \\\n    rpm2cpio /tmp/chef-client.rpm | cpio -idmv && \\\n    rm -rf /tmp/chef-client.rpm\n\nVOLUME [ \"/opt/chef\" ]\n"
