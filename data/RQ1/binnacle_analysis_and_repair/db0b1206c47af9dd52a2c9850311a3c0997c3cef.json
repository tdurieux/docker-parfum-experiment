  "repairedDockerfile": "FROM base/archlinux\nMAINTAINER Dan Yoder (dan@pandastrike.com)\n#===============================================================================\n# Orca - Agent\n#===============================================================================\n# This Dockerfile is part of the Orca project. It specifies a container running\n# an agent in the Orca.  Agents are Docker containers that are responsible for\n# some function in Orca's CoreOS cluster.  They are usually either a Leader or\n# Drone, but they can also fulfill some custom service.  Since agents load the\n# entire Orca repository, we select their ultimate role at runtime, inside the\n# service file that summons this image.\n\n# The Leader is responsible for announcing tests, gathering Drones until a quorum\n# is reached, and then collecting the results.\n\n# Drones are agents in the Orca cluster that receive instructions to download\n# tests using npm.  Once a quorum is reached, they are instructed to launch the\n# test against a target service.  They report their results to the Leader where\n# they are aggregated.\n\n\n#============================================\n# INSTALLATION\n#============================================\n\n# Install git.\nRUN pacman -Syu --noconfirm git\n\n#==============================\n# Node v0.11 and CoffeeScript\n#==============================\n# We need the powerful concurrency technologies that are only available in the currently unstable Node v0.11 and un-released \"master\" of CoffeeScript. We will have to jump through a couple extra hoops until both are released as via their package managers.\n\n# Install nvm from source.\nRUN git clone https://github.com/creationix/nvm.git ~/.nvm && \\\n  cd ~/.nvm && \\\n  git checkout `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags`\n\n# To use the commands nvm and npm, we need to prefix those commands with a source command, followed by \"nvm use v0.11\" (starting after this \"nvm install\" command, of course).\nRUN source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm install 0.11\n\n# Now install the un-relased \"master\" branch of CoffeeScript.\nRUN source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use 0.11 && \\\n    npm install -g jashkenas/coffee-script && npm cache clean --force;\n#================================\n\n# Pull the Orca repo from GitHub.\nRUN git clone https://github.com/pandastrike/orca.git\n\n# Install all other modules / dependencies.\nRUN cd orca && \\\n    source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use 0.11 && \\\n    npm install && npm cache clean --force;\n"
