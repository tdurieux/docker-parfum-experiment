Instead, you will use the online Docker\n# playground website 'Play With Docker (PWD)' to run the Theia browser example\n# by just using PWD through your browser.\n#\n# 1. First, open up http://labs.play-with-docker.com/ in your browser and\n#    create a Play With Docker session and add a new instance to your Docker\n#    playground.\n#\n# 2. Next, you will need to download this Dockerfile into your PWD session with\n#    wget.\n#\n# $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theia-ide/theia/master/examples/browser/Dockerfile\n#\n# 3. Next, ask Docker to build the image. This will take some time.\n#\n# $ docker build -t theia .\n#\n# 4. Now use Docker to run the image you just built.\n#\n# $ docker run -d -p 0.0.0.0:3000:3000 theia\n#\n# 5. There should now be a 3000 link at the top of your PWD window. Click on it\n#    to try out the Theia browser example!\n#   \n#    Note that you may get an \"Error forwarding request.\" error after clicking\n#    on the 3000 link. Please wait a few seconds before trying again as Theia\n#    may not have completely finished starting up yet.\n#\n# Note: If you want Java language support you will need to extend this image yourself\n# by adding a JDK to the image and making sure it is accessible via the system PATH.\n\nFROM node:8\nRUN useradd --create-home theia\nWORKDIR /home/theia\nRUN rm -rf /opt/yarn && rm -f /usr/local/bin/yarn && rm -f /usr/local/bin/yarnpkg\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y npm && npm install -g yarn@1.3.2 && npm cache clean --force; && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*;\nUSER theia\nRUN git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/theia-ide/theia && \\\n    cd theia && \\\n    yarn\nEXPOSE 3000\nWORKDIR /home/theia/theia/examples/browser\nENV SHELL /bin/bash\nCMD yarn run start --hostname 0.0.0.0\n"
