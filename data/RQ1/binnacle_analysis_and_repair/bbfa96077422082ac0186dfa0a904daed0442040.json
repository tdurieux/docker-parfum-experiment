That, in turn, means that it must require the following:\n#\n# 1. The Cloud SDK, which is used for cloning the source repo.\n# 2. The git command line tool, which is used for populating the source repo.\n# 3. A webserver that serves a 200 response to the \"/_info\" path.\n#\n# This should not be used when testing a build or release; for those\n# scenarios use the real image. Instead, this is meant for developers\n# modifying the CLI and wanting to quickly check their changes.\n\nFROM nginx\nMAINTAINER Google Cloud DataLab\nEXPOSE 8080\n\nRUN sed -i -e \"s/listen       80;/listen       8080;/g\" /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf && \\\n    mkdir -p /usr/share/nginx/html/_info && \\\n    echo \"<html><body>Hello from mock Datalab</body></html>\" >> /usr/share/nginx/html/_info/index.html && \\\n    apt-get update -y && \\\n    apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y -q git wget unzip python && \\\n    wget -nv https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/release/google-cloud-sdk.zip && \\\n    unzip -qq google-cloud-sdk.zip -d tools && \\\n    rm google-cloud-sdk.zip && \\\n    tools/google-cloud-sdk/install.sh --usage-reporting=false \\\n        --path-update=false --bash-completion=false \\\n        --disable-installation-options && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*;\n"
