# A Dockerfile is a simple text-file that contains a list of commands
# that the Docker client calls while creating an image.
# It's a simple way to automate the image creation process.
# The best part is that the commands you write in a Dockerfile are almost
# identical to their equivalent Linux commands. This means you don't really
# have to learn new syntax to create your own dockerfiles.

# Use ubuntu as base image, it will be downloaded automatically
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Copy index.html inside container, in /home/www

# Copy hello.py inside container, in /home/src
