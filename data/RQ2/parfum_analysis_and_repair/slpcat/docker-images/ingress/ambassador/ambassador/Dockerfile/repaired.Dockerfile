# Our base image was built from https://github.com/datawire/envoy, commit
# 6557e9ea7, on the flynn/feature/extauth branch. We need this instead of
# the official Envoy image so that we can support Ambassador's ability to
# use an external authentication service.
#
# To reproduce the base image,
#
# git clone https://github.com/datawire/envoy.git datawire-envoy
# cd datawire-envoy
# git checkout flynn/feature/extauth
#
# and then read DATAWIRE/README.md.
