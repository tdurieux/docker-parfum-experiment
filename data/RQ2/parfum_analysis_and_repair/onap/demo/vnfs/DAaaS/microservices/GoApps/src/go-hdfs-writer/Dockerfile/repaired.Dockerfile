# If you want to use the debugger, you need to modify the entrypoint to the
# container and point it to the "dlv debug" command:
#   * UNCOMMENT the following ENTRYPOINT statement,
#   * COMMENT OUT the last ENTRYPOINT statement
# Start the "dlv debug" server on port 3000 of the container. (Note that the
# application process will NOT start until the debugger is attached.)
#ENTRYPOINT ["dlv", "debug", "./cmd/hdfs-writer",  "--api-version=2", "--headless", "--listen=:3001", "--log", "--log-dest=/home.dlv.log"]

# If you want to run WITHOUT the debugging server:
#   * COMMENT OUT the previous ENTRYPOINT statements,
#   * UNCOMMENT the following ENTRYPOINT statement.
#ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/sleep", "3600"]
ENTRYPOINT ["/hdfs-writer"]
