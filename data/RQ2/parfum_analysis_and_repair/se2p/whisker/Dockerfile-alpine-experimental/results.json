  "repairedDockerfile": "################################################################################\n# Dockerfile to build a headless image of Whisker.\n# https://docs.docker.com/language/nodejs/build-images/#create-a-dockerfile-for-nodejs\n# https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/nodejs-docker-webapp/#creating-a-dockerfile\n################################################################################\n# Considered unstable because we don't use the Chromium instance bundled with\n# Puppeteer but the one that comes with the docker base image.\n# https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/#q-why-doesnt-puppeteer-vxxx-work-with-chromium-vyyy\n# Also, we use a base image based on Alpine Linux, which uses musl instead of\n# glibc. The former is more light-weigth but there can be functional differences\n# to the latter:\n# https://wiki.musl-libc.org/functional-differences-from-glibc.html\n################################################################################\n#\n# This Dockerfile is organized as a multi-stage build, which enables us to\n# reduce the size of the final image while still allowing us to use intermediate\n# layers and files without regret.\n#\n# We have the following stages:\n# (1) Build stage:\n#     (a) Prepare base image\n#     (b) Install or update build/library dependencies (via apt)\n#     (c) Install or update build/library dependencies (via yarn)\n#     (d) Build Whisker from its sources and dependencies\n# (2) Execution stage:\n#     Only copy files necessary to run Whisker and set the entry point to\n#     Whisker's servant in headless mode\n#\n# Because an image is built during the final sub-stage (d) of the build stage we\n# can minimize the size of image layers by leveraging a build cache. The\n# sub-stages are ordered from the less frequently changed (to ensure the build\n# cache is not busted) to the more frequently changed.\n#\n# Note: if you need to modify or debug this Dockerfile, you can build the image\n# only up until one of the (sub)stages by specifying \"--target <stage name>\".\n# To inspect the contents of the container at a specific stage, stop building\n# at that stage and run the container in interactive mode:\n# `docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/sh <image name>`\n################################################################################\n\n\n#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# (1) Build Stage\n#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# (a) We use a slim base image that already includes Node.JS, install Chromium\n#     for Puppeteer, and a minimal set of packages required to run it.\n#     Install the same dependencies as here (minus some fonts):\n#     https://github.com/Zenika/alpine-chrome/blob/master/Dockerfile\n#     https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/4328#issuecomment-485993010\nFROM node:lts-alpine as base\nRUN apk update \\\n    && apk --no-cache add \\\n        libstdc++ \\\n        chromium \\\n        harfbuzz \\\n        nss \\\n        freetype \\\n        ttf-freefont \\\n        tini \\\n    && rm -rf /usr/share/icons \\\n    && rm -rf /usr/local/lib/node_modules\n\n# (b) Install packages only required to build Whisker, not to run it.\n#     We need git because we have a dependency to another git repository\n#     (the Scratch VM), and ca-certificates because otherwise git cannot verfiy\n#     the server certificate.\nFROM base as build\nRUN apk update \\\n    && apk add --no-cache git\n\n# (c) Copy manifest files and install dependencies. We don't download the\n#     bundled Chromium instance of Puppeteer but reuse the one installed via\n#     apt. This makes for a smaller docker image and simplifies dependency\n#     management since apt automatically pulls in all system libraries needed to\n#     run Puppeteer. If you want to use bundled Chromium, just remove the ENV\n#     instruction below (or set it to false).\n#     Unfortunately, we need a separate COPY command for every manifest file\n#     because docker flattens the subdirectory structure when using wildcards.\n#     This layer is only rebuilt when a manifest file changes.\nWORKDIR /whisker-build/\nENV PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true\nCOPY package.json ./\nCOPY scratch-analysis/package.json ./scratch-analysis/\nCOPY servant/package.json ./servant/\nCOPY whisker-web/package.json ./whisker-web/\nCOPY whisker-main/package.json ./whisker-main/\nCOPY yarn.lock ./\nRUN yarn install && yarn cache clean;\n\n# (d) Copy source files (as governed by .dockerignore), build Whisker and drop\n#     build dependencies from the node_modules folder, keeping only the ones\n#     necessary for execution.

We use a wrapper script instead of invoking Whisker directly.\n# The script makes sure Whisker runs in headless mode, forwards console output,\n# etc. It uses the `exec` bash command [1] so that Whisker is not spawned as\n# child process of the wrapper script, but instead takes over the current process,\n# making it the container's PID 1. This is important as Unix signals (such as\n# SIGINT) sent to the container would otherwise not be received by the\n# application [2]. Yet, a Node.JS application only responds to signals when\n# **NOT** running as PID 1 [3]. Thus, we use a leightweight init system called\n# \"tini\" as entrypoint [4] that spawns Whisker as child process and forwards\n# all signals properly.\n#\n# [1] https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/commands/builtin/exec\n# [2] https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#entrypoint\n# [3] https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/blob/main/docs/BestPractices.md#handling-kernel-signals\n# [4] https://github.com/krallin/tini#existing-entrypoint\nENTRYPOINT [\"tini\", \"--\", \"/whisker/servant/whisker-docker.sh\"]\n"
