# Node.js Linux Dockerfile, for running Gulp and Webdriverio, for Talkyard.

# Let's use Debian, not Alpine, so various e2e test Bash scripts
# will work as "expected" and not run into any Alpine oddities.
#
# Nodejs Fibers 3.x, used by wdio-sync, won't build with Node 13 yet,
# wait until the new wdio-sync version that uses Fibers 4.x has been released:
# https://github.com/webdriverio-boneyard/wdio-sync/commit/dce97e0482a712660d269beb9b575bd731f26977
# (unreleased).

# The Node.js Dockerfile creates a user 'node' with id 1000.
# However, most people on Linux have id 1000 already, so 'node' = 1000
# results in an error in the entrypoint when it creates and su:s to
# a user with the same id as the host user [5RZ4HA9].
RUN userdel node
# && groupdel node  —>  groupdel: group 'node' does not exist


# Let's reinstall Python etc — needed later below, for node-gyp (KEEPDEPS)
# which is needed by the fibers module, which will get built later
# when Yarn installs node_modules/ things.
# Git is needed by gulpfile.js. The others are nice for troubleshooting, e.g. Tape security tests
# that send http requests — then curl is nice to have, so can replay the requests manually in Bash.
