It needs to be\n# built locally and pushed to the Gitlab-integrated Docker registry on the\n# Gitlab instance hosting the Azul project before that project can be built on\n# Gitlab. This should happen once after the EBS volume attached to the\n# instance is initially provisioned. Additionally, the Gitlab runner on that\n# instance needs to be configured to use it. The major version in the tag of\n# the base image should match that of the docker-dind image used on the\n# instance (look for the EC2 instance's cloud-config in the TF config\n# template). To build and push the image, and configure the runner to use it,\n# perform the following steps:\n\n# Login to the Gitlab instance's web UI.\n\n# Unless you haven't done so already, create a group called `UCSC` and a project\n# called Azul underneath it. This will ensure that the `ucsc/azul` image\n# repository is created underneath in Gitlab's image registry.\n\n# Go to your user profile settings and generate a personal access token.\n# The token needs to have `read_registry` and `write_registry` permissions.\n\n# Login with `docker` (the domain name might be different in your case):\n#\n# docker login docker.gitlab.dev.singlecell.gi.ucsc.edu\n#\n# Specify your Gitlab user name and the access token as the password.\n\n# From the directory containing this file, build the image:\n#\n# docker build -t docker.gitlab.dev.singlecell.gi.ucsc.edu/ucsc/azul/runner .\n\n# Push the image:\n#\n# docker push docker.gitlab.dev.singlecell.gi.ucsc.edu/ucsc/azul/runner\n\n# SSH into Gitlab instance and edit `/mnt/gitlab/runner/config/config.toml`.\n# Make sure that the runner(s) reserved for Azul refer to this image.\n"
