Additionally major and minor tags will be\n# applied so 15.0.260 would be tagged as \"latest\", \"stable\", \"15\" and \"15.0\", as well as \"15.0.260\".\n\nFROM busybox\nLABEL maintainer=\"Chef Software, Inc. <docker@chef.io>\"\n\nARG CHANNEL=stable\nARG VERSION=17.9.26\nARG ARCH=x86_64\nARG PKG_VERSION=6\n\nRUN wget \"https://packages.chef.io/files/${CHANNEL}/chef/${VERSION}/el/${PKG_VERSION}/chef-${VERSION}-1.el${PKG_VERSION}.${ARCH}.rpm\" -O /tmp/chef-client.rpm && \\\n    rpm2cpio /tmp/chef-client.rpm | cpio -idmv && \\\n    rm -rf /tmp/chef-client.rpm\n\nVOLUME [ \"/opt/chef\" ]\n"
