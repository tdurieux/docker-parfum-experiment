#This Dockerfile is just a primitive one. We welcome optimization and simplification.

#Attention: 
#It is best to update the process of modification in the rear of the original code(reduce the order changes).
#Otherwise the speed of construction will be influenced on a large scale.

#TODO: some space can be saved by using the low version of gcc mirror(e.g-gcc:5).
#But its mobility and dependence has not been tested yet and waiting for confirmation.
