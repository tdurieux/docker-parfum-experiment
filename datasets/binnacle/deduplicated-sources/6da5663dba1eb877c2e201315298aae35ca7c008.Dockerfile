# This Dockerfile builds an image that can be used in Google Cloud Build.
# We need the following programs to build the Nomulus app and the proxy:
# 1. Java 8 for compilation.
# 2. Node.js/NPM for JavaScript compilation.
# 3. Google Cloud SDK for generating the WARs.
# 4. Git to manipulate the private and the merged repos.
# 5. Docker to build and push images.
