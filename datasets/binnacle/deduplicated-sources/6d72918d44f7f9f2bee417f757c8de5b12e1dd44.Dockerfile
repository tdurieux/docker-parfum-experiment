# This simulation tests that if there are node both for and against the DAO hard
# fork in a single network, then the moment the hard fork commences the two sides
# will partition apart and never merge back.
#
# This is important because at a protocol/networking level the two blockchains
# are still fully compatible with each other, only content wise do they differ.
# However if they do not split apart, then all kinds of anomalies will arise when
# nodes from different forks try to sync with each other, especially during the
# fast and light sync algos which do not have access to historical content to
# verify which chain their peer's on.
