#
# Docker file for base ROS+Blender install
# No ROS nodes are started.
#
# The primary difficulty here is that Blender wants Python3
# while ROS wants Python2, and so there are install conflicts.
#
# To build:
# docker build -t opencog/ros-indigo-blender .
#
# To run:
# docker run --rm --privileged -i -v /tmp/.X11-unix/X0:/tmp/.X11-unix/X0 \
#    -v /dev/dri:/dev/dri -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm -e DISPLAY=:0.0 \
#    -t opencog/ros-indigo-blender
#
# The above should be sufficient to get blender running with full
# 3D hardware acceleration on the local host (dri==direct rendering interface)
# Note: /dev/dri=gpu, /dev/shm=gpu
