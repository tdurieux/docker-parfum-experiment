#
# Docker file to create an image that contains enough software to listen to events on the 433,92 Mhz band,
# filter these and publish them to a MQTT broker.
#
# The script resides in a volume and should be modified to meet your needs.
#
# The example script filters information from weather stations and publishes the information to topics that
# Domoticz listens on.
#
# Special attention is required to allow the container to access the USB device that is plugged into the host.
# The container needs priviliged access to /dev/bus/usb on the host.
# 
# docker run --name rtl_433 -d -e MQTT_HOST=<mqtt-broker.example.com>   --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb  <image>
