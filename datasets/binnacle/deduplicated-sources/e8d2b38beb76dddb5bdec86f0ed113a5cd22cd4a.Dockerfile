# This Dockerfile in thirdpart_containers/tomcat/dockerfile dir is used to create an image with
# AdoptOpenJDK jdk binary installed. Basic test dependent executions
# are installed during the building process.
#
# Build tomcat: `docker build -t adoptopenjdk-tomcat-test -f Dockerfile ../.`
#
# This Dockerfile builds image based on adoptopenjdk/openjdk8:latest.
# If you want to build image based on other images, please use
# `--build-arg list` to specify your base image
#
# Build example: `docker build --build-arg IMAGE_NAME=<image_name> --build-arg IMAGE_VERSION=<image_version > -t adoptopenjdk-tomcat-test .`
