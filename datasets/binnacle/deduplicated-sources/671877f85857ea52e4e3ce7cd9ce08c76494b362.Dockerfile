# This Dockerfile is intended for creating an image that contains: 
#   - Jupyter
#   - Octave and SOS kernel 
#   - Interactive plotting (e.g. plotly)
#   - osfclient
# 
# Upon successful built, /home/jovyan/work/qMRLab will contain the qMRLab with the version described
#
#   IMPORTANT! 
#   Do not modify this Dockerfile for dependency configuration. 
#   Any changes to the Python and other dependencies should be described in the
#   accompanying apt.txt and requirements.txt configuration files.
