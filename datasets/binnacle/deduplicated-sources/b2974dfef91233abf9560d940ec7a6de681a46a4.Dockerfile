# This is *almost* a copy of the file that's used for building the bundle docker image.
# The copy that the CI uses is in tests/docker/Dockerfile

# It has diverged from the original, but it's because I don't want the clutter
# of all the nodejs and friends inside a container for bundling -- kali.

# Building on ubuntu 17.10 gives glibc version compat errors.
