#
# Container for the Hanson Robotics Eva head (stand-alone Owyl version).
# This provides the complete Owyl-behavior-tree version of the demo head.
# It includes UVC webcam vision input, pi_vision to discover faces, and
# behavior controlled by Owyl trees.  This is a stand-alone version of
# the Eva head, it does not depend on or use any OpenCog software.
# In particular, it is not capable of chat.
#
# To build:
# sudo docker build -t opencog/eva-owyl .
#
FROM opencog/ros-indigo-blender
