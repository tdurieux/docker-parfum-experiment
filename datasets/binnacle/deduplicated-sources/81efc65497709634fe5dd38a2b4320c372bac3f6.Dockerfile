# This is a Dockerfile for running and building Kubernetes dashboard
# It installs all deps in the container and adds the dashboard source
# This way it abstracts all required build tools away and lets the user
# run gulp tasks on the code with only docker installed

# golang is based on debian:jessie
# Specify version to clarify which version we use.

# A small tweak, apt-get update is already run by the nodejs setup script,
# so there's no need to run it again.
