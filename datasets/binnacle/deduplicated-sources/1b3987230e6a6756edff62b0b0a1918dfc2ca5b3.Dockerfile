# docker-entrypoint.sh (from the parent image) frustratingly only creates the database
# if the "next" command it runs is "postgres".  But we want to do a migration after
# the normal startup, so we can't simply launch postgres.  So here we monkey patch
# the startup script to allow chaining to any command.  This is arguably better than
# the alternative of forking the upstream docker-entrypoint.sh entirely.
