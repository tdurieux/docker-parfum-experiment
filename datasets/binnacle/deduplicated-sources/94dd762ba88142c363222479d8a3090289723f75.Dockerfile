#Be warned that the port number must be changed in all three places for the server to appear in the serverlist (2016-05-02). I have not examinated if this is a bug or design flaw in ioquake3 or Docker but the server port is not reported correctly to the master server. 

#To change the config you can start a bash shell, install vim (or other editor) and edit the config:
#Start with: docker run -it --rm -v openarena_data:/data --user 0 sago007/openarena bash
#And then execute:
#apt-get install -y vim
#vim /data/openarena/baseoa/server_config_sample.cfg
