#   sudo docker push einar90/fieldopt:base

# This container contains the base for FieldOpt, i.e. all
# depndencies, pre-compiled.
# The FieldOpt source-code is in this container, but not built.
# A different image should be created based on this to create
# functional FieldOpt images.
#
# This is still a work in progress. In order to work fully,
# the container still needs a simulator.
