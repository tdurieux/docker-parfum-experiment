# Use APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) built in the Linux distro to download Java, a dependency
# to run Minecraft.
# First, we need to ensure the right repo is available for JRE 8
# Then we update apt
# Then we pull in all of our dependencies, 
# Finally, we download the correct .jar file using wget
# .jar file fetched from the official page https://minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/
