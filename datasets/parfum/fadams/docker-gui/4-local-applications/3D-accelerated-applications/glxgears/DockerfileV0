# Run glxgears in a container.
# This image uses the simple approach of sharing the host's X11 socket and GPU
# device with the container. This method requires the container, GPU device and
# display to be on the same host, but gives performance that is equivalent to
# running the application directly (i.e. not in a container) on the host.

FROM debian:stretch-slim

# Install glxgears
RUN apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive \
    # Add the packages used
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \

# Example usage
# 
# Build the image
# docker build -t glxgears -f DockerfileV0 .
#
# To run, noting that this will fail - the point is to see the error messages:
#
# # Create .Xauthority.docker file with wildcarded hostname.
