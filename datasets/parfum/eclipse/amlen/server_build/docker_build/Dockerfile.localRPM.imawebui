#Choose a base image that matches the type of build we are using...
#By default we use: centos7
FROM quay.io/centos/centos:7
# For a RHEL8/CentOS8 distro, we use AlmaLinux:
# ***NB: For RHEL8 - we also need to enable extra repos - see later ***
#FROM quay.io/almalinux/almalinux:8
# For Fedora, the verion changes very often due to their short life

# For RHEL8 and compatible distros, openldap-servers is not in the default repo
# and that is a prereq so one of:
#  1) CodeReady Builder stream for RHEL
#  2) PowerTools for CentOS/AlmaLinux
#  3) Symas repo
# Needs to be enabled e.g. to enable symas:
# RUN curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/sofl.repo https://repo.symas.com/configs/SOFL/rhel8/sofl.repo

# Add RPM in a temporary directory inside the container
# Make sure that imawebui.rpm is available in the directory where "docker build" command
# is being executed
ADD ./imawebui.rpm /tmp/

# Update all packages
RUN yum -y upgrade 


#To run as a non-root user
# 1) Create the user and group outside the container with a selected uid/gid
#        groupadd -r -g 463 ima
#        useradd -r  -s /sbin/nologin -g ima -u 463 ima
# 2) Give that user read/write access to any volumes that will be used
# 3) Create a config file so the RPM knows the user
#        RUN echo 'user=ima' >/etc/messagesight-user.cfg
# 4) Uncomment the RUN group/useradd setup lines:
#      (Ensure the numeric uid/gid below match step 1 above)
#        RUN groupadd -r -g 463 ima
#        RUN useradd -r  -s /sbin/nologin -g ima -u 463 ima
# 5) Uncomment the USER line above the Entrypoint before the entrypoint

# We see a bug where if the WebUI is installed in the same transaction as the java
# it depends on, java is not in the path when the postinstall scripts are run.
# We work around this by finding the required version of java and installing it first:
RUN yum deplist /tmp/imawebui.rpm |  awk '/provider:/ {print $2}' | grep java | sort -u |  xargs yum -y install

#Install the WebUI intself
RUN yum -y install /tmp/imawebui.rpm

# Delete imawebui.rpm from temporary directory
RUN rm -f /tmp/imawebui.rpm

#Uncomment below USER line to run as a non-root user (but do the above steps 1-4 as well!)
#USER ima:ima

# Set file permissions
RUN chmod -R +x ${IMA_WEBUI_APPSRV_INSTALL_PATH}
