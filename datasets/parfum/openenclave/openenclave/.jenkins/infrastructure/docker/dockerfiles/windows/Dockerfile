# Setup for the Windows Docker container uses the install-windows-prereqs.ps1 script.
# This script is the recommended method of installing the necessary prerequisites on
# a contributor's system, as well as the script used when creating CI images; it seemed
# like a logical choice to use the same work flow for setting up Docker containers.
