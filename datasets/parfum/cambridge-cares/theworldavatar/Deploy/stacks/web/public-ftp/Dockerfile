# This image houses an FTPS server and an Apache webserver. It is intended to be built into a
# container that will sit alongside a website and act as a CDN for publicly available JavaScript 
# libraries. As such, nothing added to this FTP server should be considered protected in any way.
# For more details, or to report issues, please contact CMCL Innovations.
