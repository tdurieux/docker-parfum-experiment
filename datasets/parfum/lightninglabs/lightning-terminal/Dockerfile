# There seem to be multiple problems when using yarn for a build inside of a
# docker image:
#   1. For building and installing node-gyp, python is required. This seems to
#      be missing from the NodeJS base image for ARM builds (or is just required
#      when building for ARM?).
#   2. Because of a problem in the docker internal network on ARM, some TCP
#      packages are being dropped and the yarn installation times out. This can
#      be mitigated by switching to HTTP and increasing the network timeout.
#      See https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/5259 for more info.
