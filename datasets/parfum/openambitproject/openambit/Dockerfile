#  Recommended way to build the container this creates (for lack of
#  an easy way to exclude everything but the Dockerfile):
#
#    docker build -t openambit:stretch - < Dockerfile
#
#  After that is just a matter of compiling the sources with:
#
#    docker run --rm -v $PWD:/code -u $(id -u) openambit:stretch
#
#  Doing so gives you a basic sanity check of code compilability on a
#  minimalistic, reproducible development platform.
#
#  If you don't like the defaults of building in $PWD/_build with no
#  options to either cmake or make, feel free to adjust the relevant
#  environment variables.  For example, you could build with:
#
#    docker run --rm -v $PWD:/code -u $(id -u) \
#      --env BUILD_DIR=tmp \
#      --env CMAKE_OPTS="-DBUILD_EXTRAS=1" \
#      --env MAKE_OPTS=-k \
#      openambit:stretch
#
#  Check out the --env-file option to docker if you find that overly
#  long-winded.  If you use a BUILD_DIR that is not below /code make
#  sure to drop the --rm option.
#
#  For interactive sessions, you may want to use:
#
#    docker run -i -t --rm -v $PWD:/code -u $(id -u) \
#      openambit:stretch /bin/bash
#
#  Again, drop the --rm option if you build in a location that is not
#  below /code.
