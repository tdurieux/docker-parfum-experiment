# Install the penumbra daemon into the runtime image.

# TODO(eliza): it would be nice to be able to run the Penumbra daemon in a
# `scratch` image rather than Debian or Alpine. However, then we'd have to build
# with a statically linked libc (read: musl), and musl's malloc exhibits
# pathologically poor performance for Tokio applications...
