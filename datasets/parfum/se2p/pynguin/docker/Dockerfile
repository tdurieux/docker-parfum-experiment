# Dockerfile to build a Docker container image for Pynguin.                   #
# This is a multi-stage image, i.e., it first builds the Pynguin tar-ball     #
# from the sources and installs it in a later stage for execution.            #
# The image is built in a way that it accepts all command-line parameters for #
# Pynguin as parameters to Docker's `run` command.                            #

# By setting the variable, the user acknowledges that they are aware of this.  In the
