# This is the master Dockerfile
# it should work, but AFAIK noone is currently using dweb-mirror under Docker so if not please send post a bug report or PR
# In most cases install.sh is a better way to get something running on a box.
# There is a variation of this in www-dweb-mirror repo running under Kubernates (k8) at https://www-dweb.dev.archive.org
# There is a variation of this in OLIP https://gitlab.com/bibliosansfrontieres/olip/dweb-mirror
# The changes in both those dockerfiles are incorporated below, but commented out.

# Docker quick reference - for more details check https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/
# Building
# > cd ...dweb-mirror
# > docker image build --no-cache -t mitraardron/dweb-mirror:latest .   # Use no-cache or it might not rebuild from a changed npm
# > docker push mitraardron/dweb-mirror:latest                          # Send to repo (this is usually not done)
# For testing
# > docker run -i -p 4244:4244 --name internetarchive mitraardron/dweb-mirror:latest           # Test it
# > docker run -i -p 4244:4244 --name internetarchive mitraardron/dweb-mirror:latest /bin/bash # OR run bash inside it
# For production
# > docker run -d â€”name internetarchive -p 4244:4244 mitraardron/dweb-mirror:latest    # Run production
# > docker container stop mirrorHttp                                        # Stop running server
# > docker container rm mirrorHttp                                          # Delete container
# > docker logs mirrorHttp                                                  # See the logs

## Yarn used to need installing, but is now present in alpine docker and node:12 images
# Yarn needs npm for the build, but should be happy with the version in the docker base distro
#RUN npm i npm@latest -g
# Install yarn which does a better job of de-duplicating etc
#RUN npm i yarn -g

## Need git for npm to be able to install some dependencies deep in the tree (its a known node:12 issue)
# Have to run as root to do the apt steps
USER root
# Stole this line from https://github.com/tarampampam/node-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile
# Git is neeed for install, could probably switch to the apk lines if it works on www-dweb-mirror

#RUN apt-get -yq install bash openssh-server

# OLIP uses following, but `apk` not available on the k8 www-dweb-mirror
# Also OLIP is adding python, make g++ and vips-dev which must be for debugging ?
#RUN set -ex; \
#    apk --no-cache --update add git
#    mkdir -p /root/archiveorg
#
# i386 needs some extra packages to build dweb-mirror apparently.
#RUN set -ex; \

## Connect to a persistent volume for (potentially large) data caching
# OLIP - /data/archiveorg as /data is persistent. (Added to configDefaults.yaml#directories)
# www-dweb-mirror: /root/archiveorg : data intentionally not persistent as used for testing
RUN mkdir -p /root/archiveorg

## Copy a user config for dweb-mirror, this should be in one of the locations listed in configDefaults.yaml
# Setup initial crawl - do this BEFORE the 'yarn add' of dweb-mirror
# This config file is a good place to override anything (like port numbers, or initial crawl) needed for specific applications.
# TODO-OLIP - need strategy for where to put this and where to read it
COPY ./dweb-mirror.config.yaml /root/dweb-mirror.config.yaml


## The main install, could use "COPY" but this is sure then to get a release rather than whatever is local
#Have to run install during the build otherwise will build for different environment and may fail with ELF error
RUN yarn add @internetarchive/dweb-mirror
RUN yarn add supervisor

## tell the world which port we use, doesnt actually make docker do anything
# On dweb-mirror this is 4244 and on www-dweb-archive under kubernetes (K8) is 5000
# You can change this, but it MUST match the port in dweb-mirror.config.yaml
EXPOSE 4244

##  Nasty hack to unhack this nasty line in archive.js :-) which generates unwanted logs if running on certain CI servers at IA
# K8 www-dweb-mirror only but has no negative impact on any other setup
#var log = location.host.substr(0, 4) !== 'www-' ? function () {} : console.log.bind(console);

## On K8 www-dweb-mirror only After yarn add DM, overwrite redir.html as a redirect breaks the liveness test
#COPY ./redir.html /app/node_modules/@internetarchive/dweb-archive-dist/redir.html
