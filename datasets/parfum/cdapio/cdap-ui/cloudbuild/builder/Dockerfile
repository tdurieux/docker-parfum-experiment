# It would be easier to use cypress/base:12.19.0
# However, this uses a Debian that doesn't support OpenJDK 8
# So build our own Cypress + OpenJDK 8 builder
# TODO When CDAP moves to Java 11, update this

# Install OpenJDK-8
RUN apt-get update && \
   apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk && \
   apt-get install -y ant && \
   apt-get clean;

# Fix certificate issues
RUN apt-get update && \
   apt-get install ca-certificates-java && \
   apt-get clean && \
   update-ca-certificates -f;

# Setup JAVA_HOME -- useful for docker commandline
