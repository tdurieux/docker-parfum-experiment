# To build the juno image, just run:
# > docker build -t juno .
#
# In order to work properly, this Docker container needs to have a volume that:
# - as source points to a directory which contains a config.yaml and firebase-config.yaml files
# - as destination it points to the /home folder
#
# Simple usage with a mounted data directory (considering ~/.juno/config as the configuration folder):
# > docker run -it -v ~/.juno/config:/home juno juno parse config.yaml firebase-config.json
#
# If you want to run this container as a daemon, you can do so by executing
# > docker run -td -v ~/.juno/config:/home --name juno juno
#
# Once you have done so, you can enter the container shell by executing
# > docker exec -it juno bash
#
# To exit the bash, just execute
# > exit
