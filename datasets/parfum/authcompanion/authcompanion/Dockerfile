# Cache the dependencies as a layer (the following two steps are re-run only when deps.ts is modified).
# Ideally cache deps.ts will download and compile _all_ external files used in cmd.ts.
COPY deps.ts .
RUN deno --unstable cache deps.ts

# These steps will be re-run upon each file change in your working directory:
ADD . .
