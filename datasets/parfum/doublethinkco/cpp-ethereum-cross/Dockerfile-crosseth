# Install "official" armel and armhf cross-compiler packages, which
# can be used as an alternative to our own custom crosstool-NG toolchains.
#
# NOTE - The GCC armel cross-compiler package which comes with
# Ubuntu-14.04 (Trusty) is REALLY old (GCC 4.7.2, released September 2012)
# and is pretty much unusable on this code-base.
#
# NOTE - Tizen ships with an even older version of GCC again :-)
# The Gear S2 smartwatch comes with libstdc++.so.6.0.16, which is the
# version which shipped with GCC 4.6.1, released in April 2010.   Running
# the armel binaries generated with the GCC 5.2.1 cross-compiler which
# we are now using here results in binaries which we cannot run on the
# Gear S2.  That results in the following runtime errors:
#
#     ./eth: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.21' not found (required by ./eth)
#     ./eth: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.19' not found (required by ./eth)
#     ./eth: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.17' not found (required by ./eth)
#     ./eth: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.18' not found (required by
#
# So it looks like I am going to have to specifically use an older
# sysroot to get something which can work on the Gear S2.  I am unable
# SDB connect to any of my other Tizen devices right now, so cannot verify
# if they have slightly newer runtime libraries.  The SDK does also have a
# GCC-4.9 toolchain, which perhaps was included in the Tizen 2.4 runtime?
# Using a different sysroot will involve getting GCC 4.6 headers and libraries
# onto the build machine, and then getting -sysroot into the CC and CXX
# command-lines, probably by creating a shell script which wraps the
# actual GCC binaries, as per the example below.
