RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install metasploit-framework

#Example exploit
#service postgreqsl start
#(!!!) if this is the first time you are running metasploit, run the following:
#msfdb init
#db_rebuild_cache
# start metasploit
#msfconsole

#Identify a remote host

#You can run nmap inside msfconsole and save its output into the MetaSploit database.
#db_nmap -v -sV host_or_network_to_scan[eg 192.168.0.0/24]
#This is a handy way to get an initial list of hosts on your network. I have some other tips in this linux commands for networking article
#To show a list of all available port scanners:
#search port-scan

#To list all the hosts found by nmap:

#hosts

#To add these hosts to your list of remote targets

#hosts -R
