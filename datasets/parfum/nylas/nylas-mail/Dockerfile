# This Dockerfile builds a production-ready image of K2 to be used across all
# services. See the Dockerfile documentation here:

# This installs global dependencies, then in the postinstall script, runs lerna
# bootstrap to install and link cloud-api, cloud-core, and cloud-workers.
# We need the --unsafe-perm param to run the postinstall script since Docker
# will run everything as sudo
RUN npm install --unsafe-perm

# This uses babel to compile any es6 to stock js for plain node

# We use a start-aws command that automatically spawns the correct process
# based on environmpackages/cloud-coreent variables (which changes instance to instance)
