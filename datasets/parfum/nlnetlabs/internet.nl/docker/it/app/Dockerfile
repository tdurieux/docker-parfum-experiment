# Capture the name of the base image we are extending in an environment
# variable that will be available at runtime to the integration test suite and
# can be included in the integration test report. ARG BASE_IMAGE has to be
# specified twice due to the following Dockerfile technical detail:
#
#   "An ARG declared before a FROM is outside of a build stage, so it canâ€™t be
#   used in any instruction after a FROM. To use the default value of an ARG
#   declared before the first FROM use an ARG instruction without a value
#   inside of a build stage:"
