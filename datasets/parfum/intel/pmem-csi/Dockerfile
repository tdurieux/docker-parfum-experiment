# Some of the licenses might require us to distribute source code.
# We cannot just point to the upstream download locations because those might
# disappear. We could host a copy at a location under our control,
# but keeping that in sync with the published container images
# would be tricky. So what we do instead is copy the source code
# which has this requirement into the image.
#
# Here we determine which packages were added to the runtime image,
# then get the source code of packages under a copyleft license.
#
# The check for "copyleft" is crude (= search for MPL/GPL/LGPL)
# and intentionally errs on the side of including source code
# even when the copyright file just mentions those words in some
# other context.
#
# Some known cases of non-copyleft source are therefore skipped
# directly.
#
# Copying the source code intentionally comes before building
# PMEM-CSI, because then the result is typically cached when
# a developer builds images repeatedly.
#
# The following warning can be ignored:
#   "Download is performed unsandboxed as root as file ... couldn't be accessed by user '_apt'"
