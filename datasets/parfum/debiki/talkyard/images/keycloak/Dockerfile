# Specifying -Djboss.http.port works though.
CMD ["-b", "0.0.0.0", "-Djboss.http.port=8113"]

# The entrypoint is:
# ENTRYPOINT [ "/opt/jboss/tools/docker-entrypoint.sh" ]
# so that's why setting CMD to just  "-b .. -D..." above, works
# (that is, the entrypoint already calls the docker-entrypoint.sh script
# â€” need not do from here).
