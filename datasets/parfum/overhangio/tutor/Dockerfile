# This image is still very much a work in progress. It was tested on Linux and allows
# to run tutor from inside docker. In practice, all "tutor" commands should be replaced # by:
#
#     docker run --rm -it -P \
#        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
#         -v /opt/tutor:/opt/tutor tutor
#
# Note that this image does not come with any plugin, by default. Also, the image does
# not include the `kubectl` binary, so `k8s` commands will not work.
# Because this image is still experimental, and we are not quite sure if it's going to 
# be very useful, we do not provide any usage documentation.
