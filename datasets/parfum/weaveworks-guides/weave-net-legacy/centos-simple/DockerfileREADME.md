# Getting started with Weave and Docker on CentOS - Dockerfile #

For our getting started with Weave and Docker on Ubuntu, we created a small docker image, `weaveworks/weave-gs-centos-hw`.  We have included the Dockerfile we used for creating this Docker image in our repo. While this is a very simple example it demonstrates how easy it is to create Docker images.

```bash
MAINTAINER    ilya@weave.works
FROM          centos
RUN           yum install -y httpd
RUN           yum install -y php
ADD           example/index.php /var/www/html/
ADD           example/run-httpd.sh /run-httpd.sh
RUN           chmod -v +x /run-httpd.sh
CMD           ["/run-httpd.sh"]
```

A quick explanation of the Dockerfile

- `FROM` - this is the image we have used as the basis for our image
- `MAINTAINER` - the name and/or e-mail address of the maintainer of this image
- `RUN` - a command or commands to run when creating the image
- `ADD` - add a file to the docker image you are creating
- `CMD` - a command or commands to run when the docker image is launched

As you can see here we are using the CentOS Docker image as our basis, updating this image, installing and configuring `apache2` and `php`. We then copy a new default Apache page into place. Finally when a container is launched with this image we start an Apache webserver.

The Docker documentation provides a lot more detail on [building docker images](https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/)

If you have worked through the steps in this guide you will find that this Dockerfile has been placed in the `/home/vagrant` directory on each host you created earlier.
